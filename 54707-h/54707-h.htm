<h2 id="I_HOW_TO_WALK">HOW TO WALK</h2>

<p>I have met with but one or two persons in the
course of my life who understood the art of Walking,
that is, of taking walks,&mdash;who had a genius, so to
speak, for sauntering, which word is beautifully derived
“from idle people who roved about the country,
in the Middle Ages, and asked charity, under pretense
of going <i lang="fr">à la Sainte Terre</i>,” to the Holy Land,
till the children exclaimed, “There goes a Sainte-Terrer,”
a Saunterer, a Holy-Lander. They who
never go to the Holy Land in their walks, as they
pretend, are indeed mere idlers and vagabonds; but
they who do go there are saunterers in the good
sense, such as I mean. Some, however, would derive
the word from <i lang="fr">sans terre</i>, without land or a
home, which, therefore, in the good sense, will mean,
having no particular home, but equally at home
everywhere. For this is the secret of successful
sauntering. He who sits still in a house all the time
may be the greatest vagrant of all; but the saunterer,
in the good sense, is no more vagrant than the
meandering river, which is all the while sedulously
seeking the shortest course to the sea. But I prefer
the first, which, indeed, is the most probable
derivation. For every walk is a sort of crusade,
preached by some Peter the Hermit in us, to go
forth and reconquer this Holy Land from the hands
of the Infidels.</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;Henry D. Thoreau, “Walking.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<h3>I<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW TO WALK</span></h3>

<p>Observe the vigorous man as he walks: the
stride is long and free; the feet come surely and
firmly to the ground, without twist or jar, toes
pointed straight ahead; the pelvis, swaying easily,
carries an erect body; the arms swing in alternate
rhythm with the legs; the head is borne
free over all; breathing is deep and long; the
blood courses strongly. Every member shares
in the activity.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Wearing Apparel</span></h4>

<p>It must be the pedestrian’s ideal, when he
comes to consider the matters of clothing and
burden, in the least possible degree to interfere
with these full natural bodily motions: Clothing,
while serving its purposes of protection, must not
bind nor rub; it may help to maintain, but it may
not disturb normal circulation. Burdens must
be so imposed as to be sustained with least effort,
and to leave the limbs unincumbered.</p>

<p><em>Footgear</em> is of first importance. If one is to
walk comfortably, pleasurably, effectively, the
muscles of the feet must have free play; there
may be no cramping, straining, nor rubbing; no
unnatural position. In Japan the elegant people
toddle along in rainy weather upon blocks of
wood which raise their dainty slippers above
the mud; but your rickshaw runner splashes
through the street on soles as pliant as gloves.
Shoes and stockings serve but one purpose&mdash;that
of protection. If roads were smooth and clean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
people who live in temperate climates would go
barefoot.</p>

<p>When one walks long and hard, the blood-vessels
are distended and the feet increase appreciably
in size. More than that, in the act
of walking, the forward part of the foot is constantly
changing in shape: the toes alternately
spread and contract, bend and straighten.
The whole supple member is full of muscular activity.</p>

<p>The pedestrian accordingly will not advisedly
clothe his feet in cotton stockings and close-fitting
shoes, however well made. The consequences
of so doing would be rubbing and blisters,
impaired circulation and lameness. Nor
will he put on canvas shoes, nor heelless shoes, nor
rubber-soled shoes, nor shoes with cleats across
their soles, such as football players wear.</p>

<p>The best material for <em>stockings</em> is wool, and
for shoes, leather. The preference for woolen
stockings is not primarily because of warmth&mdash;even
in hottest weather they are preferable. It
is because the material is elastic and agreeable
to the skin. In winter, warmth is an added advantage;
and, when one’s footgear is soaked
through with water, there is far less danger of
taking cold in woolen stockings than in cotton.</p>

<p>Stockings should be bulky and shoes roomy.
The layer of knit wool between foot and shoe
leather is elastic; it gives the exercising foot free
play, cushions the weight of the body, and, by filling
all the space, prevents rubbing. The rough
bulky stockings known as lumbermen’s socks are
excellent. If their coarseness is harsh to the
skin, finer socks (of cotton, if preferred) may be
worn beneath. If the woolen stockings available
are light, wear two pairs together. Never wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a stocking so small or so badly shrunken as to
draw or constrain the toes.</p>

<p><em>Shoes</em> should be roomy. They should when
put on over heavy stockings make snug fit
about the heel and beneath the arch of the foot,
but the forward part should be soft and
wide, to give the toes full play. The “sporting”
shoes of shops are to be let alone. The army
shoes are excellent, both of the Munson and of
the Hermann lasts; they have been carefully designed
for just such service as the pedestrian requires,
and they are most successful. It has just
been said that shoes should be large; they should
be considerably larger than the wearer’s ordinary
city shoes, both in length and in width. It
is not sufficient to find a shoe which is comfortable
in the shop; the shoe may be wide enough,
but unless there be some allowance in length,
one’s toes will, after ten miles of hard walking,
be squeezed till they are tender and blistered.
A man who ordinarily wears a 9 B, for example,
should buy a 9½ D. There should be
as much allowance as that, at the least. A
roomy shoe, its looseness well filled (though
not packed tight) with bulky, springy, coarse
wool, coarsely knit, is the very best foot covering.
An additional advantage should be mentioned:
a tight shoe, retarding circulation,
may in extreme wintry weather increase unduly
the danger of frosted feet. Heavy stockings and
roomy shoes are free of that defect.</p>

<p>There are no water-tight shoes, except in shop
windows; and, if there were, they would at the
end of a long walk, have become very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>A pair of army shoes should, with proper care,
last, without resoling, for 200 to 300 miles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
walking&mdash;depending on the roughness of the
way, and whether one is “hard on his shoes.”
If one is planning a longer tour than this, he
should provide two pairs of shoes, and wear them
on alternate days&mdash;a plan which, but for the
added weight, would in any case be preferable.</p>

<p>Some men prefer to walk in knickerbockers,
others in long trousers (see below). Most of
those who prefer long trousers wear shoes with
<em>high tops</em>, reaching to the middle of the calves,
and covering and confining the ends of the trouser
legs. Again, bad conditions of footing&mdash;such as
deep snow, for instance, or bog land, or low dense
growth&mdash;may render high shoetops advantageous.
Low shoes are not advisable under any conditions.
For the open road, shoes of ordinary height
are best. They should be laced, not buttoned.</p>

<p>For certain kinds of service, shoes should be
specially adapted. <em>Rubber heels</em> are excellent on
macadam roads, but it should be borne in mind
that on hard wet surfaces rubber slips. The
value of rubber heels is greatest when walking
through level, well-settled regions. When they
are worn, it is well to carry an extra pair.</p>

<p><em>Hobnails</em> are to be used only when necessary.
Any attachment to, and particularly any excrescence
from, the sole of the shoe, is disadvantageous.
Iron hobs add appreciably to the
weight; and they tend to localize a pressure
which should be evenly distributed over the whole
sole. For walking in level or in moderately hilly
regions, for such simpler mountaineering as consists
in traversing highways and mounting
wooded slopes, one does not require hobnails;
the soles of his shoes should be of plain leather.
One should let alone the rubber hobs and inlays,
the small scattered spikes, such as he sees attractively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
displayed as part of the golfer’s outfit. To
the pedestrian these things are not worth the
fancy prices asked; indeed, they are worth nothing
to him. Hobnails, then, must justify themselves
in advantages which outweigh their disadvantages;
this they do in difficult mountaineering.
Worse than useless on the level, they become in
the high mountains practically a necessity. For
climbing steep slopes, the rock faces and the
dense short turf of mountain tops, for scaling
precipices of “rotten” rock, for traversing snowfields
and icy ledges, one needs to be “rough
shod.” In the Alps the soles of the mountaineers’
shoes are studded all about their rims with <i lang="de">flügelnägel</i>&mdash;great
square-headed hobs of iron, with
“wings” overlying the edges of the soles. Soft
iron proves to be the very best material to give
purchase on rock surfaces, whether wet or dry,
and on ice and snow, too, it is best. These <i lang="de">flügelnägel</i>,
known as “edging nails,” and round hobs
for the middle of the sole, called “Swedish hobnails,”
may be had in this country from dealers in
sportsmen’s goods.</p>

<p>For mounting icy slopes, steel spikes in leather
carriers, called <em>crampons</em>, are secured to the feet
over one’s shoes. These, it is believed, are not
now procurable in this country.</p>

<p>For snowshoeing a soft-soled shoe is preferable.
Deerskin moccasins are not serviceable for,
unless protected by some outer covering, they
soon become water-soaked, and then they are
worse than useless. Shoepacks are good, and
“Barker” shoes better. Barker shoes are made
with vamp of rubber and upper of leather. On
this subject, see “The Snowshoe Manual,” compiled
by the Snowshoe Section of the Appalachian
Mountain Club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Special footwear is provided for other particular
pursuits: The duck hunter on the tide-water
procures hip-boots of rubber; the ski-runner
wears shoes of special design, and so does
the skater. But here we are in realms of sports
other than walking.</p>

<p>Footgear, then, must be comfortable, durable,
adequate.</p>

<p>Sufferers from weak or falling arches will
wisely modify these suggestions, according to
the advice of a reliable orthopedist. Indeed it is
well for any one who goes seriously about walking
to have his feet examined by a competent
adviser, that he may guard against latent defects
and prevent difficulty.</p>

<p><em>Clothing</em> should afford necessary protection;
should be light in weight, should be loose, and
should be so planned that, as one grows warm in
walking, the superfluous may be taken off. It
is best that the temperature of the body be kept
as nearly even as possible, and there is danger of
chill, if one stands in cold wind&mdash;as on a mountain
top, for instance&mdash;while his underclothing
is saturated with perspiration. Ordinarily one’s
clothing will (besides shoes and stockings) include
underwear, shirt, trousers, coat, and hat.</p>

<p>In summer, <em>underwear</em> has no value for
warmth; it should be of cotton, sleeveless, and
cut short at the knees. If, however, one is walking
in the mountains, or at a cooler season, he
will do well to carry with him a flannel undershirt,
to wear at the end of the day, when resting.
In cool weather light woolen underwear
covering both arms and legs is best&mdash;and when
the thermometer falls low or one is to endure
unusual exposure, the underwear should be heavier.
Some pedestrians will leave cotton underwear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
out of account altogether, wearing, by preference,
light wool, and, on a very hot day, none.</p>

<p>The <em>shirt</em> should be of flannel, light or heavy,
according to season. In milder weather, cotton
shirts, such as the khaki-colored ones worn in
the army and procurable at army supply stores,
are good. On a summer walking tour it is well to
provide one’s self with one cotton shirt and one
of flannel. The collarband should be large; collar
and cuffs should be of one piece with the
shirt.</p>

<p>In the matter of <em>trousers</em>, one man will prefer
long ones; another, short.</p>

<p><em>Knickerbockers</em>, for summer wear, should be of
khaki (or of one of the various close-woven cotton
fabrics which pass under that name; a material
called “cold stream duck” is good), or of
jean; for winter, they may be of corduroy
or of woolen goods. The army breeches, narrowed
at the knee, and laced close to the
calf of the leg, are riding breeches, really;
and, while fairly good, they are not of best design
for walking, since they restrain somewhat
free movement of the knee. Knickerbockers
should be full at the knee, and should end in a
band to buckle about the leg immediately below
the knee joint. Such walking breeches may be
had of dealers in sportsmen’s goods.</p>

<p><em>Leggings.</em> If knickerbockers are worn, the
calf of the leg should be properly covered. In
spite of such disadvantages as those incident to
travel on dusty roads and over burr-grown land,
long stockings secured at the knee are best for
summer wear, without more. Spiral puttees are
good in cool weather; in summer they are uncomfortably
hot, and even when carefully put on,
are somewhat confining. They have one notable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
advantage: when used in deep snow they prevent,
as no other leggings can, melting snow from running
down the legs and into the shoes. For ordinary
service the canvas puttees worn in the army
are better than the spirals&mdash;indeed these canvas
puttees are on the whole more satisfactory to the
pedestrian than any other covering applied over
shoes and stockings. Leather puttees are unnecessarily
heavy, and their imperviousness is an actual
disadvantage. It is only when traveling
through dense undergrowth and briars that
leather puttees are really serviceable&mdash;and that
sort of wear is very hard on the puttees. High
shoetops, too, become under such conditions useful,
as has already been noted.</p>

<p>In wearing breeches laced about the calf, and
in wearing spiral puttees, care should be taken
that they do not bind. Many of our soldiers in
the recent war suffered from varicose veins, and
this was attributed in part to the emergency, that
many men unused to physical labor had to carry
heavy knapsacks. But it was attributed in part,
too, to binding too tightly the muscles of the legs.</p>

<p>For one special service heavy leg covering is
desired: To the hunter traversing the swamps
and palmetto-grown plains of Florida, there is
some danger of snake bites. Ordinarily, apprehensions
about snakes are to be laughed at. The
feet, ankles, and legs to a point two or three
inches above the knees, should be protected. This
protection may be effective either by being impenetrable,
or by being bulky and thick, or by
virtue of both these characteristics. One expedient,
now on the market, consists of leggings
having an interlining of wire gauze. Another
may be improvised: a bulky wrapping of quilted
material, incased in tough leggings of leather or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
canvas. Care must be taken to protect the ankles
below the reach of an ordinary pair of puttees.
Any covering such as here suggested must in the
nature of the case be heavy and uncomfortable,
and will not be worn unnecessarily. One can
only say for it, that it is better than a snake bite.</p>

<p><em>Long trousers</em> should be of smooth close-woven
material, not easily torn by thorns, and, for winter
wear particularly, resistant to penetration by
wind. The legs of the trousers should be confined
within shoetops or leggings. Long stockings
are not required, only socks. In long trousers,
the knee movement is quite free. This rig is
particularly good for rough work.</p>

<p>Some men prefer to wear a <em>belt</em>; others, <em>suspenders</em>.
The drag of long trousers is greater
than of knickerbockers, and, generally speaking,
the man who wears knickerbockers will prefer a
belt; and the man who wears long trousers, suspenders.
The belt, when worn, should not be
drawn very tight. The best belt is the army
belt, of webbing; it should not be unnecessarily
long.</p>

<p>In summer a <em>coat</em> is needed only when resting,
or as protection from rain. On one summer tour,
the writer found himself comfortable without a
coat, but in its place a <em>sweater</em> and a short <em>rubber
shirt</em>, fitting close at neck and wrists and
with wide skirts, to cover man and knapsack together.
Such a rubber shirt, called in the supply
houses a “fishing shirt,” may be had of willow
green color, or white or black. A sweater is so
convenient to carry, and so comfortable, as to be
all but indispensable; but, as protection from
rain, the rather expensive, and for all other purposes
useless, fishing shirt is by no means a
necessity; a canvas coat or the coat of an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
business suit will answer well. One does not
walk far in a downpour, and the slight wetting
of a passing summer shower will do no harm.
In the Tyrol where, before the War, walking as
recreation was developed as nowhere else, many
pedestrians carried neither coat nor sweater, but
a long full <em>cape</em> of heavy, close-woven, woolen material;
when not needed, the cape is carried hanging
over the knapsack. Such a cape serves, in
some degree, the purposes of a blanket.</p>

<p>A convenient mode of carrying a coat is described
by Mr. William Morris Davis, in “Excursions
around Aix-les-Bains” (see <a href="#BIBLIOGRAPHY">Bibliography</a>).
Mr. Davis says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Clothing should be easy fitting, so that discomfort
shall not be added to fatigue. Even in
warm weather, a coat will often be wanted on a
ridge crest, or mountain top: it can be best carried
as follows:&mdash;Sew the middle of a 30- or 35-inch
piece of strong tape inside of the back of the
collar; sew the ends of the tape to the bottom of
the arm holes: pass the arms through the loops
of the tape, and let the coat hang loosely on the
back; it will thus be held so that nothing will fall
from the pockets and the arms and hands will be
free.”</p>

</div>

<p>For winter wear, one will dispense with any
such garment as a fishing shirt, but will require
both coat and sweater. The sweater should be
a warm one, and the coat should be, not heavy
nor bulky, but windproof rather.</p>

<p>A valuable garment for cold weather is the
Alaska “parka,” a shirt-like frock, light, windproof,
and it may be made storm-proof. Made
of heavy denim or of khaki cloth and worn over
a sweater, the parka is very satisfactory. Description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in detail will be found in <cite>Appalachia</cite>,
Vol. XI, No. 3, page 287.</p>

<p>The <em>hat</em> should shield a man’s head from a
driving rain, and, if it be a bald head, from the
sun. If the man wears spectacles, the brim of
the hat should shield the glass from rain and
from the direct rays of the sun. The hat should
be small enough and soft enough to be rolled up
and tucked away when not needed. An old soft
felt hat will do; the crown should be provided
with ventilation holes of generous size; a leather
sweatband is uncomfortable, particularly in hot
weather, and may sometimes cause bothersome
infection of a sunburned and abraded brow. The
writer has found a white duck hat, its brim faced
with green underneath, very serviceable in summer.
In tropical countries the familiar pith helmet
is an almost necessary protection.</p>

<p>One who wears eyeglasses should be careful
to provide himself with <em>spectacles</em>, preferably
metal-rimmed, and on a long tour will advisedly
carry a second pair, and even the prescription.
See further regarding spectacles, under the caption,
“Colored glasses,” <a href="#Page_22">page 22</a>.</p>

<p>The choice of <em>clothing for cold weather</em> may be
governed by these few simple rules: (1) The
objective is maximum warmth with minimum
weight. (2) The trunk of the body&mdash;the spine,
particularly&mdash;the upper arms, and the thighs
should be most warmly protected. (3) Let the
clothing be soft and bulky within (of wool
chiefly), and externally let it be substantially
windproof. The hoods worn by the Eskimos are
made of the skins of water-fowl, worn feathered
side in. (4) Have no crowding of clothing under
the arms. (5) Do not wear long coat-skirts; let
the coat be belted at the waist. (6) Protect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
ears, when necessary, with a knitted “helmet,”
or with a cap having an ear-flap which, when
not needed, folds across the crown. (7) Woolen
gloves or, better still, mittens should be worn,
and, outside of these, if it be very cold, loosely
fitting leather mittens. (8) Except in extremely
cold weather, do not wear leather garments,
nor fur. Even a fur cap is intolerable
when one becomes warm in walking.</p>

<p>The <em>color</em> of clothing is not unimportant.
Whether as naturalist or sportsman one desires
to be inconspicuously clad, or as a mere wayfarer
on dusty roads he wishes to conceal, so far as
may be, the stains of travel, he will choose khaki
color, or the olive drab made familiar nowadays
in the uniforms of the navy aviators. Gray flannel
trousers, a white sweater, a bright-colored
necktie, for wear in the evenings, are good as
part of the equipment. But to that subject the
next chapter will be devoted.</p>

<p>In planning an extended hike one will ordinarily
have to reckon on some railway traveling.
City clothes may be sent by express to the
point where walking ends. Then the return
journey may be made comfortably and inconspicuously.</p>

<p>The foregoing notes for men will be found sufficient
to indicate what is a suitable <em>costume for
women pedestrians</em>. With a woman’s needs particularly
in mind, it should be said that skirts
should be short, hanging at least six inches clear
of the ground; shoetops may be accordingly
higher; and all garments should be loose. When
walking in remote regions, many women will prefer
to wear knickerbockers rather than skirts,
and in mountaineering knickerbockers are requisite.
Even bloomers are objectionable. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
such case a woman’s costume more nearly approaches
that of men.</p>

<p>A girl, writing of a tour upon the Long Trail
in Vermont (see <a href="#Page_84">page 84</a>), says: “Khaki riding
breeches are best, as they are of light weight and
briars do not catch on them. I can’t picture any
one taking the Trail in a skirt.”</p>

<p>The Appalachian Mountain Club prescribes a
climbing outfit for women in the New England
mountains, as follows: High laced boots with
Hungarian nails; woolen stockings and underwear,
light weight; woolen or khaki waist, skirt,
and bloomers; felt hat; leather belt.</p>

<p>And the Alpine Club of Canada publishes this
among other notes upon women’s costume: “It
is the dropping of the waist line down to the hips
that is the secret of a woman’s wearing her
knickerbockers gracefully. The top of the knickerbockers
should hang on the point of the hips,
with the belt as loose as possible. This makes
discarding corsets, which of course is absolutely
necessary, most comfortable.”</p>

<p>These notes on costume are intended to cover
the subject, and to serve as reminder and advice
to those contemplating walking tours of all sorts.
But the practice of walking as an art and recreation
does not by any means require such elaborate
preparations. Otherwise, the devotees would be
few. For an extended tour, or even for a holiday
excursion, one may well give consideration to
these many matters; but for a Saturday afternoon
walk, it will suffice to put on proper footgear,
leave one’s overcoat at home, carry a
sweater if need be, use forethought about details,
and be ready to betake one’s self from
office to highway, with assurance of comfort
and enjoyment. And beyond this, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
still remains to be spoken of the daily round
of walking from home to work and back
again, from office to restaurant at noon. This
daily regimen of walking requires no special costume&mdash;admits
of none, indeed. It may be that
as one is thoughtful to take more steps on the
routine path of life, he will give more careful
attention to the shoes he buys and to clothes.
But let no one close his mind to the subject with
the too hasty conclusion that walking requires
an impossible amount of special clothing. Any
one who cares to, can make any needed modification
of his ordinary business costume, without
making himself conspicuous, and probably with
gain in comfort and consequent well-being.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Equipment</span></h4>

<p>On a one-day excursion, a man will walk unburdened;
and, on exceptional longer trips, pack-horses
may carry the baggage from one camping
ground to another; but, ordinarily, on a tour
continuing day after day, one will carry on his
own back all that he requires. Should his route
lie through settled country, where shelter and
bed are to be found in farmhouse or wayside inn,
the man will travel with lighter load, and with
greater freedom and enjoyment; if he must carry
his blanket, too, walking becomes harder work.
It may be that one will spend his vacation in the
woods, and journey partly afoot, partly by canoe.
In that case, a good part of his walking will be
the arduous toting of <i lang="la">impedimenta</i> (canoe included)
across portages, from one lake or stream
to another. Proportionately as his burden is
heavier, the sojourner in the wilderness will be
disposed so to plan his trip that he may stop for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
successive nights at favorite camping places.
From these he will make shorter trips, and, unencumbered,
climb mountains, perhaps, or explore
other parts of the country about.</p>

<p>The bulk of what is carried should be borne on
the back. Drinking cup may be hung to the belt;
knife, watch, money, and various other small articles
will be carried in pockets; map-case, field
glasses, or fishing rod may be slung by straps
from the shoulders or carried swinging in one’s
hand, ready for use; but, for the rest, everything
should be carried in the knapsack.</p>

<p>In case the pedestrian is traveling in settled
country and is not obliged to carry a blanket
(and such is by far the freest, pleasantest way
to go afoot), the best <em>knapsack</em> to be found is of
a kind in general use in the Tyrol. It goes under
its native German name, <em>rucksack</em>. It is a
large, square-cornered pocket, 20-24 inches wide
and 16-18 deep, made of a light, strong, closely
woven, specially treated fabric, of a greenish-gray
color, and all but water-proof. The pocket
is open at the top, slit a few inches down the
outer face, is closed by a drawing string, and a
flap buckles down over the gathered mouth. Two
straps of adjustable length are secured, each at
one end to the upper rim of the sack at the middle
point, and at the other end to one of the lower
corners. When the filled knapsack is in place, the
supporting straps encircle the shoulders of the
wearer, the closed mouth lies between the
shoulder blades, the bottom corners extend
just above the hips, while the weight of the burden,
hanging from the shoulders, rests in the
curve of the back. Genuine Tyrolean knapsacks
are, since the War, no longer procurable in this
country; good copies of them are, however, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
had in our sporting-goods shops. The army
knapsack is fairly good.</p>

<p>In case the pedestrian makes his tour in some
remote region, where lodging places are not certainly
to be found, he will be obliged to carry his
blanket, and probably some supply of food. In
such case, he will choose a larger knapsack.
The sack known as the “Nessmuk” is a
good one; and another, somewhat larger, is
the “Gardiner.” These sacks are neither of
them large enough to contain both blanket
and the other necessary articles of camping
equipment; the blanket should then be rolled
and the roll arched upon and secured to the knapsack
after the latter has been packed. Grommets
sewed to the knapsack afford convenient means
for securing the blanket roll in place. A still
larger (and heavier) knapsack, large enough to
contain one’s camp equipment, blanket and all,
is called the “Merriam Back Pack.” It is recommended
by an experienced camper, Mr. Vernon
Bailey, chief field naturalist of the U. S. Biological
Survey.</p>

<p>In hot weather the knapsack becomes uncomfortably
wet with perspiration. <em>Wicker
frames</em>, sometimes used to hold the sack away
from the back to allow circulation of air
beneath, are bothersome and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>For carrying heavier burdens short distances,
as when making portage on a camping trip, a
<em>pack harness</em> is used. Its name sufficiently explains
its nature. An additional device, called a
<em>tump line</em>, may, if desired, be bought and used
with the pack harness. The tump line is a band
which, encircling the load on one’s back, passes
over the forehead. With its use the muscles of
the neck are brought into play, aiding the shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and back in carrying. It is astonishing,
what an enormous burden a Canadian Indian can
manage with the aid of harness and tump line.
These articles may be bought at sportsmen’s
stores, and at the posts of the Hudson’s Bay Company,
in Canada.</p>

<p>The equipment for a summer walking tour, on
which one is not obliged to carry a blanket,
should weigh from ten to twenty pounds, according
as one carries fewer or more of the unessentials.
It is impossible to draw up lists of what
is essential and what merely convenient, and have
unanimity; one man will discard an article which
to another is indispensable; the varying conditions
under which journeys are taken will cause
the same man to carry different articles at different
times. The ensuing lists are intended to
be suggestive and reasonably inclusive; for any
given walk each individual will reject what he
finds dispensable.</p>

<p><em>Requisites carried in one’s pockets</em>: Watch;
knife; money; compass; matches; handkerchief.</p>

<p><em>Requisites carried in the knapsack</em>: Change of
underclothes, stockings, and handkerchiefs; toilet
articles; mending kit; grease for shoes.</p>

<p><em>Articles which, though not necessary, are altogether
to be desired</em>: Second outer shirt; second
pair of walking shoes, particularly if the
tour be a long one; sweater; pair of flannel trousers,
light socks and shoes (gymnasium slippers
are good), and necktie for evening wear; medicaments;
notebook and pencil; postcards or stamped
envelopes; a book to read.</p>

<p><em>Articles which may be requisite or desired, according
to season or circumstance</em>, to be carried
in pocket or knapsack or, some of them, slung
from the shoulders ready for use: Colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
glasses; pajamas; head net, as protection against
mosquitoes; woolen underclothing; gloves or mittens;
knitted helmet; naphtha soap, for washing
woolens; map case; canteen; culinary articles;
whistle; clothes brush; flashlight.</p>

<p>An indefinitely long list might be made of articles
which a man will choose, according to taste
and inclination. A bird-lover will carry a pair
of binoculars; a collector, his cases; the fisherman,
rod and fly-book. Some member of almost
every walking party will carry a camera.</p>

<p>Notes upon some of the articles thus far enumerated
will be useful:</p>

<p>The <em>pocketknife</em> should be large and strong,
with one or two blades; leave in the showcase the
knife bristling with tools of various kinds; see
that the blades are sharp.</p>

<p>Let the <em>watch</em> be an inexpensive one; leave the
fine watch at home; do not wear a wrist watch,
particularly not in warm weather. At the wrists
perspiration accumulates and the circulating
blood is cooled. Any surface covering at that
point, and particularly a close-fitting band, is in
hot weather intolerable. But, regardless of season,
a wrist watch is in the way, and is sure
soon or late to be damaged. For the pedestrian
its disadvantages greatly outweigh the
small convenience it affords.</p>

<p>The best <em>moneybag</em> is a rubber tobacco pouch;
a leather bill-folder and its contents will soon be
saturated with perspiration.</p>

<p>A <em>compass</em> is a requisite in the wilderness, but
not elsewhere. Regarding compasses, see further
pages <a href="#Page_75">75</a> and <a href="#Page_116">116</a>.</p>

<p><em>Matches</em> should be carried in a water-tight
case.</p>

<p><em>Toilet articles</em> will include, at a minimum, soap,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
comb, toothbrush and powder. A sponge or wash-rag
is desirable. A man who shaves will, unless
journeying in the wilderness, carry his razor.
The soap may be contained in a box of aluminum
or celluloid; the sponge in a sponge bag; the
whole may be packed in a handy bag or rolled in
a square of cloth and secured with strap or
string.</p>

<p><em>Towel</em> and <em>pajamas</em> are not indispensable; because
of weight, they should be classed as pedestrian
luxuries.</p>

<p>The <em>mending kit</em> will include thread, needles,
and buttons, and here should be set down safety
pins, too, an extra pair of shoestrings, and&mdash;if
one wears them&mdash;an extra pair of rubber heels.
A small carborundum whetstone may be well
worth the carrying.</p>

<p>The best dressing for leather is mutton tallow.
Various <em>boot greases</em> of which tallow is the
base are on the market; one, called “Touradef,”
is good. There are lighter animal oils, more
easily applied; a good one is called “B-ver” oil.
Mineral oils are not so good; “Viscol,” the most
widely used of these, is sold in cans of convenient
size and shape.</p>

<p><em>Medicaments</em> should be few; a disinfectant
(permanganate of potassium in crystalline form,
or tablets of Darkin’s solution), a cathartic (cascara
is best&mdash;it may be had in tabloid form, called
“Cascaral Compound”), iodine, a box of zinc
ointment, a roll of adhesive tape, and a
small quantity of absorbent cotton will suffice
for casual ailments. If one is going into the
wilderness, he may well take a first-aid kit&mdash;with
knowledge, how to use it&mdash;and medicine to deal
with more violent sickness; ipecac and calomel.
In malaria-infested regions, one should carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
quinine, with directions for administering. Talcum
powder and cocoa butter are, in proper time,
soothing. Citronella is a defense against mosquitoes;
another repellent is a mixture of sweet
oil or castor oil, oil of pennyroyal, and tar oil;
spirits of ammonia is an antidote to their poison.</p>

<p>As to <em>reading matter</em>, each will choose for himself.
The book carried may be the Bible, it may
be “The Golden Treasury,” it may be “The Three
Musketeers.” Again, it may be a handbook of
popular science or a map of the stars.</p>

<p>Regarding <em>map</em> and <em>map case</em>, see <a href="#Page_75">page 75</a>.</p>

<p><em>Colored glasses.</em> On snowfields, on the seashore,
where light is intense, the eyes should be
screened. The best material, carefully worked
out for this purpose, is Crooks glass. Its virtue
lies in this: that it cuts out both the ultra-violet
rays and the heat rays at the opposite end of the
spectrum. Crooks glass may be had in two
grades: Shade A and Shade B. Shade A, having
the properties just described, is itself almost
colorless; Shade B is colored, and cuts out, in addition,
part of the rays of the normal spectrum.
Goggles may be had of plain sheets of Crooks
glass, and these will serve merely as a screen;
but, if one wears glasses anyway, since two pairs
worn at once are difficult to manage, it is well
to have one’s prescription filled in Shade A, and
(if one is going to climb snow peaks or walk the
seabeach) then a second pair in Shade B. Ordinary
colored glasses will serve a passing need;
amethyst tint is best.</p>

<p>A <em>canteen</em> is requisite in arid regions and
when climbing lofty mountains; elsewhere it is
sometimes a justified convenience.</p>

<p>The writer well recalls the amazement of two
Alpine guides some years ago when, on the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of a snow peak, hot coffee was produced from a
thermos bottle. He hastens to add that the thermos
bottle was not his; he regards such an article
as a sure mark of the tenderfoot.</p>

<p>Even though one be traveling light, the pleasures
of a summer holiday may be widened by providing
one meal a day and eating it out of doors.
In order to accomplish this, one needs to carry
a few <em>culinary articles</em>: A drinking cup, of
course&mdash;that is carried in any case, conveniently
hung to the belt. Then one should have plate,
knife, fork, spoon, a small pail, perhaps a small
frying pan, canisters of salt and pepper, a box of
tea, a bag of sugar, a receptacle for butter. Most
of these articles, and some toilet articles as well,
may be had made of aluminum. Do not
carry glassware, it is heavy and breakable.
Don’t carry anything easily broken or easily
put out of order. But even here make exceptions.
For example, a butter <em>jar</em> is better
than a butter <em>box</em>. The writer, for one, despises
an aluminum drinking cup; when filled with hot
coffee it is unapproachable, when cool enough
not to burn the lips the coffee is too cold to be
palatable; he, therefore, in spite of its weight,
chooses to carry an earthenware cup.</p>

<p>A <em>whistle</em> will have value chiefly for signaling
between members of a party.</p>

<p>A party of two, three, or four will carry more
conveniences than a man journeying alone. For
illustration, in the party, one camera is enough,
one map case, one pail, one butter jar; and these
may be distributed, so that, while carrying only
part, each member of the party may enjoy all.
With a camera in the party, a supply of films
will be stowed away in a knapsack; a light, collapsible
tripod may be worth the taking, if one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
cares to secure pictures under poor conditions of
light.</p>

<p>Two usual items of an amateur equipment,
better left at home, are a <em>hatchet</em> and a <em>pedometer</em>.
A hatchet is of no value, except
in the wilderness, and not always is it
worth carrying even there. Ordinarily a
stout, sharp knife will answer every purpose.
When one is on a camping trip on which he makes
long stops, he will care for something better
than a hatchet&mdash;a light axe. Regarding the
uses of a pedometer see <a href="#Page_116">page 116</a>.</p>

<p>If the contemplated tour lies through the wilderness,
and accommodations for the night are
not to be had under roofs along the way, one
must carry his <em>blanket</em>. The blanket should be
selected with lightness and warmth in view. The
army blankets are fair, but softer, lighter,
warmer ones may be had. Blankets should be of
generous dimensions. A large double blanket
should not exceed eight pounds in weight, and
single blankets should weigh half as much. The
Hudson’s Bay blankets are justly famous.</p>

<p>A blanket enveloped in a windproof <em>blanket
cloth</em> is very much warmer than if not so
shielded. Herein lies the virtue of a sleeping
bag. Similarly, a tent&mdash;particularly a small one,
for one or two men&mdash;keeps out wind and retains
warm air. With the use of a tent, the weight of
blankets may be less. The blanket cloth serves
both to keep the wind from penetrating the blanket
and also to keep the blanket dry. It prevents
penetration of moisture from the ground; and,
if one is not otherwise protected, it shields one
from dew and from light rain. The blanket
cloth, too, must be of the least weight consistent
with service. Because of weight, rubber blankets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and oiled ponchos are out of the question. Better
light oilcloth, or, better still, the material
called “balloon silk” (really finely woven, long-fiber
cotton) filled with water-proofing substance.
“Tanalite” is the trade name for a water-proof
material of this sort of a dark brown color. A
tarpaulin seven feet square made of tanalite is, all
things considered, the most serviceable blanket
cloth. With blanket and tarpaulin, one’s pack
should not exceed 25-30 pounds in weight. A
mode of rolling blanket and tarpaulin and of securing
the roll to the knapsack is suggested on
<a href="#Page_18">page 18</a>.</p>

<p><em>Blanket pins</em> are worth carrying. By using
them one may keep himself snug, nearly as well
as in a sleeping bag.</p>

<p>A small cotton bag, useful in a pack, may be
stuffed with clothing and serve as a pillow.</p>

<p>A satisfactory <em>sleeping bag</em> will hardly be
found in the shops; those that are serviceable are
too heavy for the pedestrian. And yet the idea
embodied in the sleeping bag, the idea of attaining
maximum warmth from the materials used,
jumps precisely with the pedestrian’s needs.</p>

<p>The difficulty with the sleeping bags on the
market is that they are made for gentlemen
campers, and not for those who take up their
beds and walk. For one thing, the gentleman
camper has abundance of clothing, with changes
of all kinds. But the pedestrian sleeps in his
clothes. Of course he does. It would be folly for
him to carry in his pack the equivalent of what
he wears on his back. His day clothes should be
serviceable as night clothes, too. All he need
carry is the additional protection required when
he is resting on the ground in the colder night
hours. And, in addition, he will have a change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of the garments which lie next his skin; but no
more. If when sleeping a man is not wearing all
that he carries, then he is carrying more than is
necessary. He may, indeed, have stuffed in his
pack woolen underclothes, for night wear only.
For another thing, in making choice between
one material and another, the weight of the
material is important in far greater degree
to the walker than to the gentleman camper.
With these considerations in mind, the pedestrian
contrives his sleeping bag of the lightest
material available to serve the ends in view.</p>

<p>Essentially, a sleeping bag is a closed covering
of two layers: an inner layer of heat-insulating
material, and an outer layer of water-tight, wind-tight
material. Even the gentleman camper,
scornfully referred to above, chooses the lightest,
warmest blankets he can find; the pedestrian can
do no better. However, he does not take so
many. But, respecting the outer covering, the
pedestrian refuses the heavy water-proofed duck
of the ordinary sleeping bag, and selects instead
water-proofed balloon silk.</p>

<p>The simplest sleeping bag may be made by
folding a six by six wool blanket within a cover
of water-proofed balloon silk and sewing together
the bottom edges, and the side edges, too, from
the bottom upward, to within a foot or so of the
top. The bag measures approximately three feet
by six, and should not weigh more than five and
one half pounds.</p>

<p>Instead of the blanket, other material may be
used. Men differ in the amount of covering they
require; and then there are the inequalities of
climate and season to be reckoned with. A suitable
material, lighter than wool and affording less
warmth, is sateen; a somewhat warmer, somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
heavier, substitute for the wool blanket is
a down quilt. When still greater warmth is
needed the blanket may be double, or blanket and
down quilt may be combined.</p>

<p>A rectangular bag, such as that just described,
may be criticized in two particulars: for one
thing, it is not long enough for a man of good
stature, and, for another thing, there is waste
material in it. It would be just as warm and just
as serviceable if, instead of being three feet wide
at the bottom, it were at that point only two feet
wide.</p>

<p>The specifications of an excellent sleeping bag
for pedestrian use are given in a pamphlet published
by the Appalachian Mountain Club,
“Equipment for Mountain Climbing and Camping,”
by Allen H. Bent, Ralph Lawson, and Percival
Sayward, and with the courteous assent of
the designers, are here incorporated.</p>

<p>A bag made on the dimensions given is suitable
for a man five feet eleven inches tall.</p>

<p>A strip of the material for the inner layer is
cut to the pattern indicated below. It is 87
inches long, and at its widest point 32½ inches
across. The widest point is 45 inches from the
foot. At the foot the strip is 20 inches wide, and
at the head, 21 inches. The sides are outwardly
curved. This is the <em>under</em> strip.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/diagram1.jpg" width="700" height="300" alt="The pattern described above" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>A second <em>upper</em> strip is, in over-all dimensions,
a duplicate of the first, but for the fact
that it is 9 inches shorter. From the foot up and
for a length of 78 inches it is identical with the
first strip, but at that point it is cut short. A
face opening is cut in the upper edge of the second
strip, 10 inches across and 11 inches deep.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/diagram2.jpg" width="700" height="340" alt="The pattern described above" />
</div>

<p>These two strips are superposed and their
overlying edges are sewed together. All edges
are properly hemmed or bound.</p>

<p>As the user lies in the bag, his feet just reaching
the bottom, his face is encircled in the face
opening. The excess length of the under strip
then becomes a flap, to fold over his head. Buttons
and buttonholes may be provided, as indicated
in the drawings, to secure the flap in such
position.</p>

<p>The material for the outer layer is cut to the
same pattern, with sufficient enlargement of dimensions
to allow the outer bag to contain the
inner bag and cover it smoothly.</p>

<p>The outer material will preferably be water-proofed
balloon silk (“tanalite”); the inner material
may be sateen, or blanketing, or down quilt.
The designers suggest still another material:
Australian wool wadding, encased in sateen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
They say, “a brown sateen material is the
best covering, as a very finely woven goods is
necessary to keep the wool from working
through. The bag does not need to be quilted,
but should be ‘tied through’ about every six
inches.”</p>

<p>The balloon silk outer bag should weigh about
one and one-quarter pounds; the bag of sateen
should weigh about two and one-quarter pounds.
C. F. Hovey Co., 33 Summer St., Boston, and the
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., Madison Ave. and
Forty-fifth St., New York, have made bags to
these specifications.</p>

<p>It remains only to add a word respecting the
outer cover of balloon silk. Balloon silk, which
in reality is a fine-woven cotton, is, relatively
speaking, a delicate material, and furthermore it
is not perfectly water-tight. The great advantage
of lightness justifies its use. But the bag
must be carefully handled, and after hard service
the cover must be renewed.</p>

<p>Dr. Charles W. Townsend, of Boston, an experienced
camper, writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The sleeping bag is a home-made affair, that
takes up only a small part of the room in a rucksack,
and weighs four pounds. It is made of
lamb’s wool wadding, lined with sateen, and covered
with flannel. It is about six and one-half
feet long and tapers, so as to be wider at the
mouth than at the foot. With ordinary clothing,
I have slept warm in it with a temperature of
forty degrees. I have also a balloon-silk cover,
which can be arranged to guy-ropes, to make a
lean-to tent over my head, and gauze curtains for
insects. I think that weighs two and one-half
pounds.”</p>

</div>

<p>A <em>tent</em> will be carried when the route lies
through unsettled country. In a sparsely settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
region, one will run the risk of heavy rain for
a night or two, rather than bother with a tent;
but in the wilderness, a tent is a necessity, for
even such a tarpaulin as has been described as
a suitable blanket cover, is not perfectly water-tight.
One cannot sleep out in a driving rain
storm. At a pinch, of course, one can make shift,
and perhaps under rock ledge or shelter of boughs
keep fairly dry; but after a wet night in the
open, one needs assured protection the second
night. The lightest tents are made of balloon
silk; they weigh four pounds and upwards. Two
men traveling together will have a tent in common
and will distribute and equalize their burdens.
As has been said, a tent affords warmth
(particularly when carefully pitched, with a view
to making it wind-tight) and, accordingly, blankets
need not be so heavy. Though water-proofed
balloon silk is not perfectly water-tight, one may
keep perfectly dry in a balloon silk tarpaulin or
sleeping bag, within a balloon silk tent.</p>

<p>A note on <em>sleeping out</em> is proper. In summer,
when there is no rain, one should sleep under
the open sky; he should choose as his sleeping
place an exposed ridge, high and dry. In such a
situation he will suffer least annoyance from
mosquitoes, and, if the night be cool, he will be
warmer than in the valley. Seldom in temperate
climates is the night too warm for sleeping out
of doors; but even on such a night the air on
the hilltop is fresher. If it be windy, a wind-break
may be made of boughs or of cornstalks
(on a cool night in autumn a corn-shock may be
made into a fairly comfortable shelter.) In case
the evening threatens rain, one may well seek
a barn for protection; if one is in the wilderness,
he will search out an overhanging rock, or build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a lean-to of bark or boughs. Newspaper is a
good heat insulator, and newspapers spread on
the ground where one is to lie make the bed a
warmer, drier one. Newspaper will protect one’s
blanket from dew. Be careful when lying down
to see that shoes and clothing are under cover.
If the night proves to be colder than one has
anticipated and one’s blanket is insufficient (or
if, on another tour, the days are so hot that walking
ceases to be a pleasure&mdash;though they have to
be <em>very</em> hot for that), it may be expedient, at a
pinch, to walk by night and rest by day.</p>

<p>Such <em>food</em> as must be carried will be selected
to save weight, so far as is consistent with nutriment.
Rolled oats are excellent; so also is soup
powder (put up in “sausage” form, imitating
the famous German <i lang="de">erbswurst</i>), and dried fruits
and vegetables, powdered eggs, and powdered
milk. The value of pemmican is known. All
these articles may be obtained at groceries and
at sportsmen’s stores. Seldom, however, will one
wander so far as to be for many days beyond the
possibility of buying food of more familiar form.
Shelled nuts, raisins, dried fruit, malted milk
tablets, and lime juice tablets are good to carry
on an all-day excursion. <em>Food bags</em> of “paraffined”
cotton fabric will prove useful. It is well
to bear in mind that food may be distributed
along the way, sent in advance by mail, to await
at post offices one’s coming.</p>

<p>The special equipment of the mountaineer&mdash;alpenstock,
ice axe, rope, <em>crampons</em>, <em>scarpetti</em>, etc.&mdash;need
only be mentioned. They are not needed
in climbing the mountains of eastern America,
but only on giddy peaks, snowfields, and glaciers.
Those interested will consult the works on mountaineering
mentioned in the Bibliography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>From the pages of a pamphlet of the Appalachian
Mountain Club this note is taken:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Equipment does not end with the purchase of
proper food, clothing, climbing and camping outfit.
The prospective climber should give some
thought to his physical and mental equipment.
A strong heart, good lungs, and a reasonable
amount of physical development and endurance
are among the requisites and so, too, are courage,
caution, patience and good nature. If in addition
he is interested in topography, geology, photography,
animal or plant life, by so much the more
is his equipment, and consequently his enjoyment,
increased.”</p>

</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Care of Body and Equipment</span></h4>

<p>As to speed of walking and distance, see below,
<a href="#Page_51">page 51</a>; as to preliminary walking, in preparation
for a tour, see <a href="#Page_53">page 53</a>.</p>

<p>One hardly needs the admonitions, eat plain
food, sleep long, and keep body and clothing
clean. The matter of <em>food</em> becomes complicated
when one has to carry the supply of a day or two
or of several days with him. Be careful to get,
so far as possible, a large proportion of vegetable
food&mdash;fresh vegetables and fruit.</p>

<p>When walking, the system requires large
amounts of water, and, generally speaking, one
should <em>drink</em> freely. If one stops by a roadside
spring on a hot day, he should rest a few minutes
before drinking, and, if the water be very
cold, he should drink sparingly. It is refreshing
before drinking, and sometimes instead of drinking,
to rinse mouth and throat with spring water.
In the Alps the guides caution one not to drink
snow water. In settled regions, drink boiled
water only, unless assured of the purity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
source. Beware of wells. It is a matter of
safety, when traveling, to be inoculated against
typhoid fever. Practice restraint in the use of
ice cream, soda water, sweets, coffee, and tea.</p>

<p>The pedestrian should be careful to get as
much <em>sleep</em> as normally he requires at home,
and somewhat more. He may not be so regular
in hours, for he will find himself inclined to sleep
an hour at midday, and at times to walk under
the starlight, to be abroad in the dawn. And a
walking tour would be a humdrum affair, if he
did not yield to such inclination.</p>

<p>A <em>bath</em> at the end of the day&mdash;a sponge bath,
if no better offers&mdash;is an indispensable comfort.
While on the march one will come upon inviting
places to bathe. Bathe before eating, not immediately
after. If the water is very cold, it is
well to splash and rub one’s body before plunging
in. If much bathing tends to produce lassitude,
one should limit himself to what is necessary.</p>

<p>Don’t overdo; on the march, when <em>tired out</em>,
stop at the first opportunity&mdash;don’t keep going
merely to make a record. Don’t invite fatigue.
If, in hot weather, free perspiration should fail,
stop immediately and take available measures to
restore normal circulation.</p>

<p><em>Lameness</em> in muscles is due to the accumulation
of waste matter in the tissues; elimination may
be aided and lameness speedily relieved by drinking
hot water freely and by soaking one’s body
in a warm bath: the internal processes are accelerated,
in freer blood circulation, while much is
dissolved out through the pores of the skin. At
the end of a long hard walk, the most refreshing
thing is a drink&mdash;not of ice water, not of soda
water, but a pint or so of hot water. Rubbing
oil as a remedy for lame muscles is hardly worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
carrying; alcohol is a mistake. Bruised muscles
should be painted lightly with iodine.</p>

<p><em>Care of feet.</em> Always wash the feet thoroughly
at the end of a tramp, and dry carefully, particularly
between the toes. If the skin cracks
and splits between the toes, wash at night with
boric acid and soften with vaseline. It is better
to allow toenails to grow rather long, and in
trimming cut them straight across.</p>

<p>When resting at noon take off shoes and stockings,
and, before putting them on again, turn the
stockings inside out. If the weather be mild, let
the feet remain bare until about to set out again;
if there be water available, bathe the feet immediately
on stopping. If, on the march, the arch of
the foot should grow tired, consciously “toe in.”</p>

<p>If there is rubbing, binding, squeezing, with
consequent tenderness at any point, stop at once,
take off shoe and stocking, and consider what is
to be done. It may suffice to protect the tender
spot, applying a shred of absorbent cotton secured
with a strip of adhesive tape; perhaps the
thickness of the stocking may be changed, or the
lacing of the shoe be eased or tightened. By
<em>tighter</em> lacing sometimes the play of the foot
within the shoe may be diminished and undesirable
rubbing or squeezing overcome. Talcum
powder sprinkled on the foot will help to relieve
rubbing, and soap rubbed on the stocking outside,
above the tender place, is efficacious.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in spite of forethought, one may
find one’s self walking in ill-fitting shoes; for example,
the shoes though broad enough may be
too short, and one’s toes in consequence may be
cramped and squeezed in the toe of the shoe&mdash;particularly
on down grades&mdash;until they become
tender and even blistered. If then other expedients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
fail, one has to examine his shoe carefully,
determine precisely where the line of binding
strain lies, and then&mdash;remembering that the shoe
as it is, is worthless to him&mdash;slit leather and
lining through, in a line transverse to the line of
strain.</p>

<p>Should a blister, in spite of care, develop, let
it alone, if possible. Don’t interfere with nature’s
remedial processes. But, if one must go on
walking with the expectation that the blister
unless attended to will tear open, then one should
drain it&mdash;not by pricking it through, however.
Take a bright needle, sterilize it in the flame of a
match, and run it under the skin from a point to
one side, and so tap the blister. Then cover the
area with adhesive tape. If there is abrasion,
paint the spot with iodine, or apply a few crystals
of permanganate of potassium and a drop or two
of water, then cover with absorbent cotton and
adhesive tape.</p>

<p>Be careful, on setting out in the morning, that
any soreness or lameness of the preceding day
has been met by the measures described.</p>

<p>Corns are caused by wearing tight or ill-fitting
shoes. If one has a corn, he should get rid of it
before attempting distance walking, and should
thereafter wear shoes such as to assure him immunity.</p>

<p>For <em>sunburn</em>, use talcum powder or cocoa butter.
Do not expose large areas of the body to
sunburn.</p>

<p>A <em>cramp</em> in the side may easily be relieved by
drawing and retaining a deep breath, and bending
over.</p>

<p>The <em>bowels</em> should be kept open, and will be, if
one orders his food aright. Constipation is to be
carefully guarded against. One may, in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
himself, after hard walking in hot weather, find
difficulty. A harmless emergency relief is an
enema of a few ounces of the colorless inert oil
now sold under such names as “Russian” oil and
“Nujol” (the Standard Oil Company’s preparation).</p>

<p><em>Medicines</em> are to be used only in emergency:
cascara for constipation, or, in case of a sudden
violent onset of illness, calomel; capsicum plaster
for internal inflammation. But hot water within
and without will generally relieve distress, and
is the best remedy. But <em>do not experiment</em>; if a
physician is available, call him.</p>

<p>Ammonia is an antidote for insect stings.</p>

<p>Snake-bites are, newspaper reports to the contrary,
very, very rare. The bite of a poisonous
serpent (rattlesnake or copperhead) requires
heroic treatment. Suck the wound, cut it out
immediately with a sharp knife, fill the incision
with permanganate of potassium crystals and
drop water upon the permanganate.</p>

<p><em>Care of clothing.</em> Underclothes and stockings
worn today may be washed tomorrow at the noon
hour. Shirt, trousers&mdash;and underclothing too&mdash;should
go to the tub every few days, as opportunity
offers.</p>

<p>Shoes should be cleaned each day, washed in
cold water and greased. If wet they should be
carefully dried in gentle heat. Leather is easily
ruined by scorching; never dry a shoe in heat
unendurable to the hand. Shoes packed in newspaper
overnight will be measurably dried by
absorption. Keep the leather pliant with grease
or oil, but not saturated. If one is going to
walk through bogs, or in shallow water, then
his shoes should be copiously oiled, but ordinarily
one should oil his shoes with sparing hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Companions</span></h4>

<p>Dr. Finley, President of the University of the
State of New York, and Commissioner of Education,
finely says:<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> “It is figurative language, of
course, to speak of God’s ‘walking’ with man.
But I do not know where to find a better expression
for the companionship which one enjoys
when walking alone on the earth. I should not
speak of this if I thought it was an experience
for the patriarchs alone or for the few. A man
does not know one of the greatest satisfactions
of life if he has not had such walks.”</p>

<p>The prophets of the cult&mdash;Hazlitt and Stevenson&mdash;are
quite eloquent on the point, that the first
joys of walking are reserved for those who walk
alone; even Emerson cynically observes that a
dog may on occasion be better company than a
man. But the solitary Thoreau admits that he
sometimes has a companion, while sociable
Lawrence Sterne prettily says, “Let me have a
companion of my way, were it but to remark
how the shadows lengthen as the sun declines.”</p>

<p>Ordinarily, we prefer&mdash;most of us&mdash;to walk in
company; if the tour is an extended one, continuing
through many days, we certainly do. And
nothing is more important than the choice of
companions. A mistake here may be a kill-joy.
Daily, hourly intercourse rubs individuality upon
individuality, till every oddity, every sensitive
point, is worn to the quick. Be forewarned, then,
and be sure of one’s companions. Conversely, let
a man be sure of himself, resolutely refusing to
find offense, or to lose kindliness, good humor,
and good will. “’Tis the best of humanity,” says
Emerson, “that goes out to walk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>A common interest in things seen, stimulated
perhaps by reading matter carried along, may be
the selective process in making up a party; but
friendship underlies all.</p>

<p>A proved company of two, three, or four is
best. With greater numbers, the party loses intimacy
and coherence; furthermore, if dependent
on hospitality by the way, difficulties arise. A
housewife who willingly provides for two, may
hesitate to entertain six.</p>

<p>If there be one in the party who has an aptitude
for it, let him keep a <em>journal</em> (in the form
of letters home, perhaps). Such a record, illustrated
by photographs, is a souvenir to afford
long-continued delight.</p>

<p>When walking in out-of-the-way places it is the
part of prudence always to have a companion;
for, otherwise, in case of mishap, a man might be
in sorry plight, or even in actual danger.</p>

<h3>II<br />
<span class="smaller">WHEN TO WALK</span></h3>

<p>Any day&mdash;every day, if that were possible.
Says Thoreau, “I think that I cannot preserve
my health and spirits, unless I spend four hours
a day at least [in the open]”; and, again, he says
of himself that he cannot stay in his chamber for
a single day “without acquiring some rust.”</p>

<p>Recall Thoreau’s Journals. Their perennial
charm lies largely in this, that he is abroad
winter and summer, at seedtime and at harvest,
in sun and rain, making his shrewd observations,
finding that upon which his poetic fancy may
play, finding the point of departure for his Excursions
in Philosophy.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">At What Season</span></h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first care of a man settling in the country
should be to open the face of the earth to himself
by a little knowledge of Nature, or a great deal,
if he can; of birds, plants, rocks, astronomy; in
short, the art of taking a walk. This will draw
the sting out of frost, dreariness out of November
and March, and the drowsiness out of
August.”</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;Ralph Waldo Emerson, “Resources.”</p>

</div>

<p><em>The Daily Walk.</em> Walking is to be commended,
not as a holiday pastime, merely, but as
part of the routine of life, in season and out.
Particularly to city-dwellers, to men whose occupations
are sedentary, is walking to be commended
as recreation. Will a man assert himself
too busy?&mdash;his neighbor plays a game of golf a
week; he himself, perhaps, if he will admit it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
is giving half a day a week to some pastime&mdash;may
be a less wholesome one.</p>

<p>It is worth a man’s while to reckon on his
walking every day in the week. It may well be
to his advantage, in health and happiness, to extend
his daily routine afoot&mdash;perhaps by dispensing
with the services of a “jitney” from the
suburban station to his residence, perhaps by
leaving the train or street car a station farther
from home, perhaps by walking down town to
his office each morning.</p>

<p><em>The Weekly Walk.</em> The environs of one’s home
can scarcely be too forbidding. A range of ten
miles out from Concord village satisfied Thoreau
throughout life. Grant the surroundings of Concord
exceptional&mdash;Thoreau’s demands were exceptional.
Those who will turn these pages
will be for the most part city folk; the resident
of any of our cities may, with the aid of
trolley, railway, and steamboat, discover for himself
a dozen ten-mile walks in its environs&mdash;many
of them converging to his home, some
macadam paved and so available even in the
muddy season, and any one of them possible on
a Saturday or a Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>What could a pedestrian ask more? A three-hour
walk of a Saturday afternoon&mdash;exploring,
perhaps, some region of humble historic interest,
studying outcroppings of coal or limestone, making
new acquaintance with birds, bees, and
flowers, and enjoying always the wide sky, the
sweep of the river, the blue horizon. No other
recreation is comparable to this.</p>

<p>It is pleasurable to walk in fair, mild weather;
but there is pleasure on gray, cold, rainy days,
too. To exert the body, to pit one’s strength
against the wind’s, to cause the sluggish blood to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
stream warm against a nipping cold, to feel the
sting of sleet on one’s face&mdash;to bring all one’s
being to hearty, healthful activity&mdash;by such
means one comes to the end, bringing to his refreshment
gusto, to his repose contentment.</p>

<p>The consistent pedestrian will score to his
credit, every week throughout the year, ten miles
of vigorous, sustained tramping. Five hundred
miles a year makes an impressive showing, and
is efficacious: it goes far to “slam the door in the
doctor’s nose.”</p>

<p><em>The Walking Tour.</em> Apart from, or, better, in
addition to the perennial weekly walking about
one’s home, there is the occasional walking tour:
a two or three-day hike, over Labor Day, perhaps,
or Washington’s Birthday; and then there
is the longer vacation tour of two or three weeks’
duration.</p>

<p>With important exceptions, we, in our northern
latitudes, arrange our walking tours in summer
time. And, so far as concerns the exceptions, it
will here suffice to remind ourselves of mountain
climbing on snowshoes in winter, of ski-running
and skating, and of the winter carnivals of sport
held in the Adirondacks, in the Alps, and in the
Rocky Mountains. In our southern states, however,
no disadvantage attaches to winter; to the
contrary, over a great part of that region, winter
is the pleasanter season for the pedestrian.
But summer is the season of vacations, and is,
generally speaking, the time of good roads, fair
skies, and gentle air. Then one can walk with
greatest ease and freedom.</p>

<p>The choice of the particular fortnight for the
“big hike” may be governed by all sorts of considerations;
if the expedition be ornithological,
and there is free choice, it will be taken in May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
or June, or perhaps in September; if to climb Mt.
Ktaadn, it will preferably be in August.
Again, one’s employer may, for his own reasons,
fix the time. It is well, therefore, to formulate
general statements, helpful in making choice of
place, when once the season has been fixed.</p>

<p>In early summer, from the time the snow
melts till mid July, the north woods are infested
with buzzing, stinging, torturing mosquitoes; to
induce one to brave these pests, large countervailing
inducements must needs appear. Mountaineering
in temperate latitudes is less advisable
in the early summer than later; there is more
rain then, and nights are cold, and, in the high
mountains, soft snow is often an impedance.
Throughout much of our country, June is a rainy
month. In May and June, accordingly, and early
July, one should by preference plan his walk in
open settled country, in the foothills of mountain
ranges, or across such pleasant regions as central
New York or Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Late July, August and September are, for the
most part, hot and dusty. At that season, accordingly,
the great river basins and wide plains
should be avoided; one should choose rather the
north woods, the mountains, or the New England
coast.</p>

<p>For the pedestrian September in the mountains
and October everywhere are the crown of
the year; the fires of summer are then burning
low, storms are infrequent, the nip in the air
stirs one to eagerness for the wide sky and the
open road.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The world has nothing to offer more rich and
entertaining than the days which October always
brings us, when after the first frosts, a steady
shower of gold falls in the strong south wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
from the chestnuts, maples and hickories: all the
trees are wind-harps, filling the air with music;
and all men become poets, and walk to the measure
of rhymes they make or remember.”</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;Ralph Waldo Emerson, “Country Life.”</p>

</div>

<p>If one is so fortunate as to have his holiday
abroad, he will find the Italian hills or the Riviera
delightful either in early spring or in late
autumn; he will find the Alps at their best in
midsummer; and, at intermediate seasons, there
remain the Black Forest and the regions of
the Seine, the Rhine, and the Elbe. As for Scotland
and Ireland, no one has ventured to say
when the rains are fewest.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Hours of the Day</span></h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Can you hear what the morning says to you,
and believe <em>that</em>? Can you bring home the summits
of Wachusett, Greylock, and the New
Hampshire hills?”</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;Ralph Waldo Emerson, “Country Life.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is well, and altogether pleasantest, on the
hike, to be under way early in the morning; and
sometimes&mdash;particularly if the day’s march be
short&mdash;to finish all, without prolonged stop. Ordinarily,
it is preferable to walk till eleven or
twelve o’clock, then to rest, wash clothing, have
lunch, read, sleep, and, setting out again in the
middle of the afternoon, to complete the day’s
stage by five or six o’clock. Afterward come
bath, clean clothes, the evening meal, rest, and an
early bed.</p>

<p>But one’s schedule should not be inflexible; one
should have acquaintance with the dawn, he
should know the voices of the night. One forgets
how many stars there are, till he finds himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
abroad at night in clear mountain air. An
all-night walk is a wonderful experience, particularly
under a full moon; and, in intensely hot
weather, a plan to walk by night may be a very
grateful arrangement.</p>

<p>Dr. John H. Finley, of the University of the
State of New York, writes in the <cite>Outlook</cite><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> reminiscently
of walking by night:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But the walks which I most enjoy, in retrospect
at any rate, are those taken at night.
Then one makes one’s own landscape with only
the help of the moon or stars or the distant lights
of a city, or with one’s unaided imagination if
the sky is filled with cloud.</p>

<p>“The next better thing to the democracy of a
road by day is the monarchy of a road by night,
when one has one’s own terrestrial way under
guidance of a Providence that is nearer. It was
in the ‘cool of the day’ that the Almighty is
pictured as walking in the garden, but I have
most often met him on the road by night.</p>

<p>“Several times I have walked down Staten
Island and across New Jersey to Princeton ‘after
dark,’ the destination being a particularly attractive
feature of this walk. But I enjoy also the
journeys that are made in strange places where
one knows neither the way nor the destination,
except from a map or the advice of signboard
or kilometer posts (which one reads by the flame
of a match, or, where that is wanting, sometimes
by following the letters and figures on a post
with one’s fingers), or the information, usually
inaccurate, of some other wayfarer. Most of
these journeys have been made of a necessity that
has prevented my making them by day, but I
have in every case been grateful afterward for
the necessity. In this country they have been
usually among the mountains&mdash;the Green Mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
or the White Mountains or the Catskills.
But of all my night faring, a night on the moors
of Scotland is the most impressive and memorable,
though without incident. No mountain
landscape is to me more awesome than the moorlands
by night, or more alluring than the moorlands
by day when the heather is in bloom. Perhaps
this is only the ancestors speaking again.</p>

<p>“But something besides ancestry must account
for the others. Indeed, in spite of it, I was
drawn one night to Assisi, where St. Francis had
lived. Late in the evening I started on to Foligno
in order to take a train in to Rome for Easter
morning. I followed a white road that wound
around the hills, through silent clusters of cottages
tightly shut up with only a slit of light
visible now and then, meeting not a human being
along the way save three somber figures accompanying
an ox cart, a man at the head of the
oxen and a man and a woman at the tail of the
cart&mdash;a theme for Millet. (I asked in broken
Italian how far it was to Foligno, and the answer
was, ‘<i lang="it">Una hora</i>’&mdash;distance in time and not in
miles.) Off in the night I could see the lights of
Perugia, and some time after midnight I began
to see the lights of Foligno&mdash;of Perugia and
Foligno, where Raphael had wandered and
painted. The adventure of it all was that when
I reached Foligno I found that it was a walled
town, that the gate was shut, and that I had
neither passport nor intelligible speech. There
is an interesting walking sequel to this journey.
I carried that night a wooden water-bottle, such
as the Italian soldiers used to carry, filling it
from the fountain at the gate of Assisi before
starting. Just a month later, under the same full
moon, I was walking between midnight and
morning in New Hampshire. I had the same
water-bottle and stopped at a spring to fill it.
When I turned the bottle upside down, a few
drops of water from the fountain of Assisi fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
into the New England spring, which for me,
at any rate, has been forever sweetened by this
association.</p>

<p>“All my long night walks seem to me now as
but preparation for one which I was obliged to
make at the outbreak of the war in Europe. I
had crossed the Channel from England to France,
on the day that war was declared by England, to
get a boy of ten years out of the war zone. I
got as far by rail as a town between Arras and
Amiens, where I expected to take a train on a
branch road toward Dieppe; but late in the
afternoon I was informed that the scheduled
train had been canceled and that there might not
be another for twenty-four hours, if then. Automobiles
were not to be had even if I had been
able to pay for one. So I set out at dusk on foot
toward Dieppe, which was forty miles or more
distant. The experiences of that night would
in themselves make one willing to practice walking
for years in order to be able to walk through
such a night in whose dawn all Europe waked to
war. There was the quiet, serious gathering of
the soldiers at the place of rendezvous; there
were the all-night preparations of the peasants
along the way to meet the new conditions; there
was the pelting storm from which I sought
shelter in the niches for statues in the walls of
an abandoned château; there was the clatter of
the hurrying feet of soldiers or gendarmes who
properly arrested the wanderer, searched him,
took him to a guard-house, and detained him until
certain that he was an American citizen and a
friend of France, when he was let go on his way
with a ‘<i lang="fr">Bon voyage</i>’; there was the never-to-be-forgotten
dawn upon the harvest fields in which
only old men, women, and children were at work;
there was the gathering of the peasants with
commandeered horses and carts in the beautiful
park on the water-front at Dieppe; and there was
much besides; but they were experiences for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
most part which only one on foot could have had.”</p>

</div>

<p>In answer to a request for a contribution to
this handbook, Dr. Finley replies generously, and
to the point:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have never till now, so far as I can recall,
tried to set down in order my reasons for walking
by night. Nor am I aware of having given
specific reasons even to myself. It has been sufficient
that I have enjoyed this sort of vagrancy.
But since it has been asked, I will try to analyze
the enjoyment.</p>

<p>“1. The roads are generally freer for pedestrians
by night. One is not so often pushed off
into the ditch or into the weeds at the roadside.
There is not so much of dust thrown into one’s
face or of smells into one’s nostrils. More than
this (a psychological and not a physical reason)
one is not made conscious by night of the contempt
or disdain of the automobilist, which really
contributes much to the discomfort of a sensitive
traveler on foot by day. I have ridden enough
in an automobile to know what the general automobile
attitude toward a pedestrian is.</p>

<p>“2. Many landscapes are more beautiful and
alluring by moonlight or by starlight than by
sunlight. The old Crusader’s song intimates
this: ‘Fair is the sunlight; fairer still the moonlight
and all the twinkling starry host.’ And
nowhere in the world have I appreciated this
more fully than out in Asia Minor, Syria, and
Palestine, where the Crusaders and Pilgrims
walked by night as well as by day. But I have
particularly agreeable memories, too, of the night
landscapes in the Green Mountains.</p>

<p>“3. By night one is free to have for companions
of the way whom one will out of any age
or clime, while by day one is usually compelled,
even when one walks alone, to choose only from
the living and the visible. In Palestine, for example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
I was free to walk with prophet, priest,
and king by night, while by day the roads were
filled with Anzacs and Gurkhas and Sikhs, and
the like. Spirits walk by day, but it takes more
effort of the imagination to find them and detach
them. One of my most delightful night
memories is of a journey on foot over a road
from Assisi that St. Francis must have often
trod.</p>

<p>“4. There is always the possibility of adventure
by night. Nothing can be long or
definitely expected, and so the unexpected is always
happening. I have been ‘apprehended’&mdash;I
do not like to say ‘arrested’&mdash;several times when
walking alone at night. Once, in France, I was
seized in the street of a village through which
I was passing with no ill intent, taken to a guard-house
and searched. But that was the night of
the day that war was declared. Once, and this
was before the war, I was held up in Rahway,
toward midnight, when I was walking to Princeton.
I was under suspicion simply because I
was walking, and walking soberly, in the middle
of the road.</p>

<p>“5. By day one must be conscious of the physical
earth about one, even if there is no living
humanity. By night, particularly if one is walking
in strange places, one may take a universe
view of things. Especially is this true if the
stars are ahead of one and over one.</p>

<p>“6. Then it is worth while occasionally to see
the whole circle of a twenty-four hour day, and
especially to walk into a dawn and see ‘the eye-lids
of the day.’ I had the rare fortune to be
on the road in France when the dawn came that
woke all Europe to war. And I was again on the
road one dawn when the war was coming to its
end out in the East.</p>

<p>“7. There are as many good reasons for walking
by night as by day. But no better reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
than that one who loves to walk by night can
never fear the shadow of death.</p>

<p>“You will ask if I have any directions to give.
I regret to say that I have not. I seldom walk
with else than a stick, a canteen of water, and a
little dried fruit in my pocket&mdash;and a box of
matches, for sometimes it is convenient to be able
to read signboards and kilometer posts even by
night.”</p>

</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Speed and Distance</span></h4>

<p>Stevenson speaks contemptuously of “the
championship walker in purple stockings,” and
indeed it is well to heed moderate counsel, lest,
in enthusiasm for <em>walking</em>, one misses after all
the supreme joys of a <em>walk</em>. At the same time,
there is danger of too little as well as of too
much. To loiter and dilly-dally (to borrow again
Stevenson’s phrase) changes a walk into something
else&mdash;something more like a picnic.</p>

<p>Really to walk one should travel with swinging
stride and at a good round pace. Ten or
twenty miles covered vigorously are not half so
wearying to body nor to mind as when dawdled
through. One need not be “a champion walker
in purple stockings” covering five miles an hour
and fifty miles a day.</p>

<p>If one is traveling without burden, he should
do three and a half to four miles an hour; if he
carries twenty pounds, his pace should be not
more than three and a half; and if he carries
thirty, it should be three miles an hour, at most.
When traveling under a load, one has no mind
to run; on an afternoon’s ramble, one may run
down gentle grades “for the fun of it,” but on
the hike it is best always to keep one foot on the
ground. The perennial, weekly, conditioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
walk should require about three hours; and the
distance covered should be at least ten miles. On
a tour, continued day after day, one should ordinarily
walk for five, six, or seven hours a day, and
cover, on the average, fifteen to twenty miles.
With three weeks to spare, one has, say, ten to
fifteen walking days&mdash;rain may interfere, there
are things to be seen, one does not want to walk
every day. At the average rate of twenty miles
a day&mdash;which one can easily do under a fifteen-pound
pack&mdash;the distance covered should be 200
to 250 miles. If one carries thirty pounds, he
travels more slowly, and makes side trips, and
covers a stretch of say a hundred miles of
country.</p>

<p>The figures given are applicable to walking
in comparatively level regions; in mountain
climbing, of course, they do not hold. To ascend
three thousand feet in elevation, at any gradient,
is at the least a half-day’s work; it may be much
more. Furthermore, in mountaineering at great
and unaccustomed altitudes&mdash;8,000 feet and upwards&mdash;great
care must be taken against over exertion.
One who has had experience in ascending
Alpine peaks will remember that, under the
leadership of his guides, he was required to stop
and rest for fifteen minutes in each hour, to eat
an Albert biscuit, and to drink a swallow of tea
mixed with red wine.</p>

<p>Professor William Morris Davis, in “Excursions
around Aix-les-Bains,” gives the following
notes upon speed in mountain-climbing:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“While walking up hill, adopt a moderate pace
that can be steadily maintained, and keep going.
Inexperienced climbers are apt to walk too fast
at first and, on feeling the strain of a long ascent,
to become discouraged and “give it up”; or if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
they persist to the top, they may be tempted to
accept bodily fatigue as an excuse for the indolent
contemplation of a view, the full enjoyment
of which calls for active observation. Let
these beginners remember that many others have
shared their feelings, but have learned to regard
temporary fatigue as a misleading adviser.
There is no harm done if one becomes somewhat
tired; exhaustion is prevented by reducing the
pace when moderate fatigue begins. Let the
mind rest on agreeable thoughts while the body
is working steadily during a climb; when the
summit is reached, let the body rest as comfortably
as possible while the mind works actively in
a conscious examination of the view. Avoid the
error of neglecting the view after making a great
effort in attaining the view point.</p>

<p>“An ascent of 400 or 475 m. [1300-1550 feet]
an hour may ordinarily be made on a mountain
path; where paths are wanting, ascent is much
slower; where rock climbing is necessary, slower
still. Descent is usually much shortened by cutoffs
at zigzags in the path of ascent: the time of
descent may be only a half or a third of that required
for ascent.”</p>

</div>

<p>One should not set out on any tour, whether
in the mountains or elsewhere, and, without
preparation, undertake to do twenty miles a day.
During the weeks preceding departure, one
should be careful not to miss his ten-mile weekly
hike; and he should, if possible, get out twice a
week, and lengthen the walks.</p>

<p>In planning his itinerary, he will not fix the
average distance and walk up to it each day. Let
him go about the matter gradually&mdash;fifteen miles
the first day, twenty the second; on the third
day let him lie by and rest, and on the fourth
do twenty again. With the fourth day he will
find his troubles ended. The second day is, usually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the hardest&mdash;ankles tired, feet tender,
shoulders lame from the burden of the knapsack;
but, by sticking at it bravely through the afternoon,
the crest of difficulty will be overpassed.</p>

<p>In this matter of speed and distance, figures
are to be accepted with freedom. Individuals
vary greatly in capacity. The attempt has been
made to give fair estimates&mdash;a rate and range
attainable by a fairly vigorous, active man, with
clear gain. The caution should be subscribed,
“Do not try to do too much.”</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Stunt Walking</span></h4>

<p>These are tests of endurance in speed, in distance,
or in both; the play of the habitual pedestrian.
Discussion of the matters of <em>speed</em> and
<em>distance</em> gives opportunity for the introduction,
somewhat illogically, of this and the following
sections.</p>

<p>There is, in the environs of a certain city, a
walk of ten miles or better, a favorite course with
a little company of pedestrians. No month
passes that they do not traverse it. Normally,
they spend two hours and a half on the way; if
some slower-footed friend be of the party, it requires
an hour more; their record, made by one
of their number, walking alone, is two hours and
twelve minutes.</p>

<p>Fired by the example of a distinguished pedestrian,
who in the newspapers was reported to have
walked seventy-five miles on his seventy-fifth
birthday, one of the company just mentioned
essayed to do the like&mdash;a humbler matter in his
own case. He is, however, so far advanced into
middle age that he won with a good margin the
trophy of the League of Walkers, given to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
member who covers thirty miles afoot in a single
day.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Competitive Walking</span></h4>

<p>Mr. George Goulding, the Canadian world’s
champion, has generously contributed the following
paragraphs on Competitive Walking. The
definition of a “fair gate,” taken by Mr. Goulding
for granted, is, “one in which one foot touches
the ground before the other leaves it, only one
leg being bent in stepping, namely, that which is
being put forward.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the present mad scramble of the business
world, men forget the need of exercise; they are
intent on rapid transit, but give little thought
to walking. Walking is the natural mode of
travel, it is one of the best forms of exercise, and
should be engaged in by everyone, and by most
people in larger degree.</p>

<p>“If ordinary walking for health and recreation
has fallen into disuse, so has speed walking in
competition. There are, however, still a few of
the old school left, in Weston, O’Leary, Ward,
and others, who remind us of the time when the
art of fast walking was more highly esteemed in
the athletic world.</p>

<p>“You have asked me to give my ideas on fair
heel and toe walking for competition, or speed
walking, and in replying I ask you at the outset
to take Webster’s Dictionary from your shelf and
see what the definition of <em>walk</em> is: ‘To proceed
[at a slower or faster rate] without running or
lifting one foot entirely before the other is set
down.’ Based on that definition, a set of rules
has been drawn up to govern the sport, differentiating
a fast walk from a running trot. The
chief thing for the novice just starting is to get
thoroughly acquainted with the rules and stick
to them, never violating them in the slightest.</p>

<p>“I cannot here make minute comment upon all
the rules of championship walking, but I will do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
my best to bring out in a brief way the essentials.
To simplify and make vivid what I have in
mind to say, let the reader accompany me to some
athletic track and see with me a bunch of walkers
in action.</p>

<p>“It is a principle of walking which I have set
before myself, to economize effort, to attain
maximum speed with minimum expenditure of
strength; but you do not see that principle carried
out by all the walkers before you on the
track. One fellow over there is twisting his body
on the back stretch in an awful contortion, showing
he is not a natural walker. Another, just behind
him, is jumping in a jerky way all the time,
owing to the fact that he is not using his hips
to advantage. But look at this young chap just
taking the turn, how smoothly he works! What
freedom of action he has! Look at his hop motion!
In order to get a better view, let us step
out upon the track. Now see how his hip is
brought well round at each stride, the right being
stretched out a little to the left, and the left in
the next stride to the right, in order that he can
bring his feet, one directly in front of the other.
Notice that he walks in a perfectly straight line.
That is to say, if a direct line were drawn around
the track, he would place each foot alternately
upon it. Bear in mind that the shortest distance
between any two points is a straight line. By
this time the walker has passed us, and we get
a view of him from the field. In contrast with
the other contestants, he does not seem to have
any hip action. That is because his stride is
perfectly straight, no overlapping; his stride
shoots out right from the waist; he gets into it
every possible inch, and yet there is no disturbance
of the smoothness of his action. And with
his perfect stride note how he works his feet to
advantage: the right foot comes to the ground
heel first, and as the left leg is swung in front
of the right, the ball of the right comes down;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
then, as the right foot rises to the toe position,
the heel of the left strikes the ground and in turn
takes the weight of the body. Notice how one
foot is on the ground all the time; there is no
possibility of a lift. A good test, to judge
whether a walker is ‘lifting’ or not, is to note
whether his head moves in a straight line; for,
when one lifts, the head moves up and down.</p>

<p>“Now notice the difference in the way the different
men ‘lock’ their knees. The knee should
be perfectly straight or ‘locked’ as the foremost
foot reaches the ground, and should continue so
through the beginning of the stride. It is easier
to reach forward with a straight knee than with
a bent one. As the heel comes to contact with
the ground, the weight of the body is shifted
from the rearward to the forward foot, and the
leg that has just swung forward now begins to
propel the body. The straightened knee is at this
instant locked. The ‘lock’ should be decided and
complete. Remember this clearly, that the knee
should be first straight and then locked. A knee
bent throughout the stride is not to be approved.
The rules call for a fair heel and toe walk, with
a stiff knee, and we have got to live up to them.</p>

<p>“With our walkers still in view as they go
around the track, let us study their arm motion.
Notice how that fellow is slashing away across
his chest. That is not necessary. Neither is the
action of the man just ahead of him, who is
throwing his arms away out laterally from the
hips. Now look at the fellow with the freedom
of action we have already noted. His arms are
fairly low, they do not rise higher than the
breast. On the forward swing of his arm the
elbow does not pass the hip, and on the backward
swing the hand does not pass the hip. The
man does not carry corks. (The less concentration
of mind upon the action of muscles the
better.)</p>

<p>“I think I have illustrated the chief points involved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in walking according to the rules laid
down. Perhaps a summary of the rules for fair
heel and toe walk will be useful:</p>

<p>“<em>Hip motion</em>: Just enough twist or curve given
to bring the feet alternately in one straight line.</p>

<p>“<em>Leg action</em>: Below the waist shoot the leg out
in a straight clean drive to its full, natural limit:
hip locked, knee locked, and free play given the
foot.</p>

<p>“<em>Foot action</em>: The heel of the right foot strikes
the ground first. As the left leg is swung in
front of the right, the foot of the right comes
down flat, then, as it is raised to toe position, the
heel of the left strikes the ground and in turn
takes the weight of the body.</p>

<p>“<em>Carriage of the body</em>: To be perfectly upright,
with the center of gravity on the heels, the
head all the time traveling in a straight line.</p>

<p>“<em>Knee action</em>: Knee to be straight at first and
afterwards locked.</p>

<p>“<em>Arm action</em>: Arms act with the shoulders to
give good balance. Keep them fairly low, not
ascending any higher than the nipples; good even
swing; hand and elbow alternately reaching the
hips.</p>

<p>“<em>Hands</em>: Recommended to be kept loose, corks
not necessary.</p>

<p>“Having pointed out to you wherein individuals
differ, and having indicated what constitutes a
fair heel and toe walk, a few hints on training
may be helpful. My first advice to any athletic
aspirant is to undergo a medical examination, in
order to find out if he is strong enough constitutionally
to risk strenuous track work without injury
to his health. I would further suggest that
such an examination be an annual affair.</p>

<p>“What is the purpose of training? We train to
gain efficiency in whatever branch of sport we
enter. To train properly one must concentrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
attention upon whatever pertains to his particular
sport. Through such attention one strengthens
the muscles and nerves, gains knowledge of
the strength he possesses, so that he can use it
in the right way and at the right time, to attain
the maximum amount of speed with the minimum
amount of effort. Training increases strength
of mind, self-confidence, strong nerves, patience,
thinking power, and character.</p>

<p>“The amount of track work needed to prepare
for a walking-match will depend upon the individual,
but remember that staying in bed and
reading a set of rules will not do. There is a
lot of hard work ahead. To start with, I would
never think of entering a race without at least
three months’ preparation, be it daily or three
times per week. A long and careful training is
far better than a short and severe one, and so I
would recommend easy work for the first month,
with a gradual increase of speed as one goes
along. Do not bother with a stop watch until
the second month at the earliest.</p>

<p>“Let me also suggest that one do a little morning
calisthenics. These exercises should focus
on developing alertness and endurance; consequently,
light, rapid movements that give the
muscles tone and firmness are the qualities to
seek in such individual exercise.</p>

<p>“I have always found deep breathing a great
help when training for a contest. I always practice
deep breathing when out for a street walk,
inhaling through about eight steps, exhaling for
a like period.</p>

<p>“One of the things I learned early in my career
was the value of sun baths. The blood needs
light, and one needs pure blood to win a race.
The direct rays of the sun on one’s body will
give it. Of course one should use discretion in
taking a sun bath.</p>

<p>“One should not forget that he needs a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
sleep&mdash;eight full hours of it. Sleep is necessary
for resting not the body only; it should also be
a rest for the mind and the nervous system. Remember
that sleep is not mere rest in the sense
of inaction; sleep is a vital process in repairing
and rebuilding used-up nerve and brain cells, so
you see it is essential that the brain be at rest
in order to gain full recuperation.</p>

<p>“As one becomes more advanced in the sport he
will realize how large a part the mind plays in
a race. Mental action has a great deal to do
with winning. A man should not be bluffed; let
him make up his mind he is going to win, and
that he must not get rattled; let him have his
thoughts well collected, and he will be all right.”</p>

<h3>III<br />
<span class="smaller">WHERE TO WALK</span></h3>

<p>Anywhere. Surely the pedestrian may claim
for his recreation this advantage: it may be enjoyed
when one will and wherever one may be.
But this does not mean that there is no choice, no
preference. Says Thoreau again, “If you would
get exercise, go in search of the springs of life.
Think of a man’s swinging dumb-bells for his
health, when those springs are bubbling up in
far-off pastures unsought by him!” And Emerson
has this fresh, breezy comment:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The true naturalist can go wherever woods or
waters go; almost where a squirrel or a bee can
go, he can; and no man is asked for leave. Sometimes
the farmer withstands him in crossing his
lots, but ’tis to no purpose; the farmer could as
well hope to prevent the sparrows or tortoises.
It was their land before it was his, and their title
was precedent.”</p>

</div>

<p>Stevenson would make the surroundings a matter
of small import; the landscape, he says, is
“quite accessory,” and yet, within a page after,
he rallies Hazlitt, and playfully calls him an epicure,
because he postulates “a <em>winding</em> road, and
three hours to dinner.”</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Choice of Surroundings</span></h4>

<p>There is the region about home, the region
one knows best. For muddy weather, macadam;
but, when they are at all negotiable, then always
country roads by preference. The macadam road
is all that is unpleasant&mdash;hard, dry, glaring,
straight, monotonous; overrun with noisy, dusty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
evil-smelling machines, with their curious and
often unpleasant occupants. It is bordered, not
with trees, as a road should be, but with telephone
poles; a fine coating of lime dust lies like
a death pallor on what hardy vegetation struggles
to live along its margin; it is commercial,
business-like, uncompromising, and unlovely.
But the country road belongs to another world&mdash;a
world apart&mdash;and is traveled by a different
people. It, too, has its aim and destination, but
it is deliberate in its course; it neither cuts
through the hills nor fills the valleys, but accommodates
itself to the windings of streams and
to the steepness of slopes. It is soft underfoot,
shaded by trees; it finds and follows the mountain
brooks; rabbits play upon it, grouse dust
themselves in it, birds sing about it, and berries
hang from its banks black and sweet. The people
who live in the country travel upon it; it is
instinct with the life of a hundred years.</p>

<p>If the day be clear, seek the hilltops; if not,
the wooded valleys. The pedestrian learns the
by-paths, too, and the short cuts across lots. He
can find the arbutus in its season, the blackberries
and the mushrooms in theirs. Here is a
suggestive page from Thoreau’s Journal (August
27, 1854):</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Would it not be well to describe some of those
rough all-day walks across lots?&mdash;as that of the
15th, picking our way over quaking meadows and
swamps and occasionally slipping into the muddy
batter midleg deep; jumping or fording ditches
and brooks; forcing our way through dense blueberry
swamps, where there is water beneath and
bushes above; then brushing through extensive
birch forests all covered with green lice, which
cover our clothes and face; then, relieved, under
larger wood, more open beneath, steering for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
some more conspicuous trunk; now along a rocky
hillside where the sweet-fern grows for a mile,
then over a recent cutting, finding our uncertain
footing on the cracking tops and trimmings of
trees left by the choppers; now taking a step or
two of smooth walking across a highway; now
through a dense pine wood, descending into a
rank, dry swamp, where the cinnamon fern rises
above your head, with isles of poison-dogwood;
now up a scraggy hill covered with scrub oak,
stooping and winding one’s way for half a mile,
tearing one’s clothes in many places and putting
out one’s eyes, and find[ing] at last that it has no
bare brow, but another slope of the same character;
now through a corn-field diagonally with
the rows; now coming upon the hidden melon-patch;
seeing the back side of familiar hills and
not knowing them,&mdash;the nearest house to home,
which you do not know, seeming further off than
the farthest which you do know;&mdash;in the spring
defiled with froth on various bushes, etc., etc.,
etc.; now reaching on higher land some open
pigeon-place, a breathing-place for us.”</p>

</div>

<p>Another page, too, is worth quoting (July 12,
1852):</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now for another fluvial walk. There is always
a current of air above the water, blowing
up or down the course of the river, so that this
is the coolest highway. Divesting yourself of
all clothing but your shirt and hat, which are
to protect your exposed parts from the sun, you
are prepared for the fluvial excursion. You
choose what depths you like, tucking your toga
higher or lower, as you take the deep middle of
the road or the shallow sidewalks. Here is a
road where no dust was ever known, no intolerable
drouth. Now your feet expand on a smooth
sandy bottom, now contract timidly on pebbles,
now slump in genial fatty mud&mdash;greasy, saponaceous&mdash;amid
the pads. You scare out whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
schools of small breams and perch, and sometimes
a pickerel, which have taken shelter from
the sun under the pads. This river is so clear
compared with the South Branch, or main stream,
that all their secrets are betrayed to you. Or
you meet with and interrupt a turtle taking a
more leisurely walk up the stream. Ever and
anon you cross some furrow in the sand, made by
a muskrat, leading off to right or left to their
galleries in the bank, and you thrust your foot
into the entrance, which is just below the surface
of the water and is strewn with grass and
rushes, of which they make their nests. In shallow
water near the shore, your feet at once
detect the presence of springs in the bank emptying
in, by the sudden coldness of the water, and
there, if you are thirsty, you dig a little well in
the sand with your hands, and when you return,
after it has settled and clarified itself, get a
draught of pure cold water there.…</p>

<p>“I wonder if any Roman emperor ever indulged
in such luxury as this,&mdash;of walking up and down
a river in torrid weather with only a hat to shade
the head. What were the baths of Caracalla
to this?”</p>

</div>

<p>It might seem that all the joys of walking are
rural; but it is not so; the city dweller knows as
well as his country cousin how to make his surroundings
serve his need. Doctor Finley, veteran
pedestrian though he be, delighting to walk to
the ends of the earth, has no word of disdain for
the streets of the city of his home. The following
passage is taken from a paper of his which
appeared in the <cite>Outlook</cite> and from which quotation
has already been made:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My traveling afoot, for many years, has been
chiefly in busy city streets or in the country roads
into which they run&mdash;not far from the day’s work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
or from the thoroughfares of the world’s concerns.</p>

<p>“Of such journeys on foot which I recall with
greatest pleasure are some that I have made in
the encircling of cities. More than once I have
walked around Manhattan Island (an afternoon’s
or a day’s adventure within the reach of thousands),
keeping as close as possible to the water’s
edge all the way round. One not only passes
through physical conditions illustrating the various
stages of municipal development from the
wild forest at one end of the island to the most
thickly populated spots of the earth at the other,
but one also passes through diverse cities and
civilizations. Another journey of this sort was
one that I made around Paris, taking the line of
the old fortifications, which are still maintained,
with a zone following the fortifications most of
the way just outside, inhabited only by squatters,
some of whose houses were on wheels ready for
‘mobilization’ at an hour’s notice. (It was near
the end of that circumvallating journey, about
sunset, on the last day of an old year, that I saw
my first airplane rising like a great golden bird
in the aviation field, and a few minutes later my
first elongated dirigible&mdash;precursors of the air
armies.)…</p>

<p>“About every city lies an environing charm,
even if it have no trees, as, for example, Cheyenne,
Wyoming, where, stopping for a few hours
not long ago, I spent most of the time walking
out to the encircling mesas that give view of
both mountains and city. I have never found a
city without its walkers’ rewards. New York has
its Palisade paths, its Westchester hills and hollows,
its ‘south shore’ and ‘north shore,’ and its
Staten Island (which I have often thought of as
Atlantis, for once on a holiday I took Plato with
me to spend an afternoon on its littoral, away
from the noise of the city, and on my way home
found that my Plato had stayed behind, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
never reappeared, though I searched car and
boat). Chicago has its miles of lake shore walks;
Albany its Helderbergs; and San Francisco, its
Golden Gate Road. And I recall with a pleasure
which the war cannot take away a number of
suburban European walks. One was across the
Campagna from Frascati to Rome, when I saw
an Easter week sun go down behind the Eternal
City. Another was out to Fiesole from Florence
and back again; another, out and up from where
the Saone joins the Rhone at Lyons; another,
from Montesquieu’s château to Bordeaux; another,
from Edinburgh out to Arthur’s Seat and
beyond; another from Lausanne to Geneva, past
Paderewski’s villa, along the glistening lake with
its background of Alps; and still another, from
Eton (where I spent the night in a cubicle looking
out on Windsor Castle) to London, starting
at dawn. One cannot know the intimate charm of
the urban penumbra who makes only shuttle
journeys by motor or street cars.”</p>

</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Nature of Country</span></h4>

<p>When it comes to the matter of choosing the
region for a walking tour, all sorts of considerations
enter in. This has been indicated already;
your naturalist will fix upon some happy hunting
ground where flowers or birds are abundant, or
fossil trilobites or dinosaurs are to be discovered;
the fisherman will seek out the mountain brooks;
the antiquarian, some remote rural region, perhaps,
or scene of battle; the genealogist will
visit the graves of his ancestors. But, leaving
for the moment such special and individual considerations
out of account, what should influence
the average pedestrian in his choice of locality?</p>

<p>The choice of locality with relation to season
has already been considered, <a href="#Page_43">page 43</a> above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The choice will not fall upon a flat, undiversified
region, particularly if the season be hot and
the roads much traveled and dusty. Emerson, in
a passage extolling the pedestrian advantages of
his native Massachusetts, observes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For walking, you must have a broken country.
In Illinois, everybody rides. There is no good
walk in that state. The reason is, a square yard
of it is as good as a hundred miles. You can
distinguish from the cows a horse feeding, at the
distance of five miles, with the naked eye. Hence,
you have the monotony of Holland, and when you
step out of the door can see all that you will
have seen when you come home.”</p>

</div>

<p>Having said so much, Emerson adds, in order
to put the Illinoian in good humor again:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We may well enumerate what compensating
advantages we have over that country, for ’tis a
commonplace, which I have frequently heard
spoken in Illinois, that it was a manifest leading
of the Divine Providence that the New England
states should have been first settled, before the
Western country was known, or they would never
have been settled at all.”</p>

</div>

<p>In Oklahoma, they say, one can look farther
and see less than anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>The pedestrian seeks wide horizons, but he
seeks more than that. The only classical walk
which the writer now recalls, taken in a level
region, was Thoreau’s tour along the beaches of
Cape Cod; but there was the sea&mdash;itself an unending
delight and stimulus to imagination&mdash;and
the sand dunes, with all the beauties of mountain
form in miniature.</p>

<p>There are, of course, the great recreation
grounds of the world: the Swiss Alps, the Tyrol,
and in our own country the Glacier National
Park, the Yellowstone, and the Yosemite. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a place is the pedestrian’s paradise. But such a
place is, for most of us, far away; ordinarily, the
requirement is of something humbler.</p>

<p>Let the choice then be broken country. There
is all of New England, the Adirondacks, the Appalachian
region, the Ozarks, and the great
mountain lands of the West. Some fringe of one
or another of these regions is accessible to almost
any holiday seeker. In addition to the mountainous
areas, there are the drumlins and lakes of
our glaciated northern states&mdash;New York, Michigan,
Wisconsin; and, excepting only the prairies,
there is diversity of rolling hills and winding
streams everywhere.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Goal and the Road</span></h4>

<p>It is well to have an objective in a walk, a
focus of interest, a climax of effort: a historical
objective&mdash;the grave of Washington, perhaps, or
the battlefield of Israel Putnam; or a natural
objective&mdash;the summit of Mt. Marcy, or Lake
Tahoe, or the Mammoth Cave.</p>

<p>Do not, however, set out from the point of
chief interest; let there be a gradual approach;
if possible, let the hardest work come near the
end; let the highest mountain be the last.</p>

<p>Search out objects of interest within five hundred
miles of home, choose one of them as the
goal&mdash;be it mountain, trout stream, or Indian
mound&mdash;and let the way lead to it.</p>

<p>On long tours, seek variety&mdash;variety of woods,
rivers, mountains. Do not, by choice, go and
return over the same road, nor even through
the same region. Better walk one way and go
by train the other.</p>

<p>In crossing mountain ranges, ascend the gradual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
slope and descend the steep. (On precipices,
however, there is less danger in climbing up than
down.)</p>

<p>Walk from south to north, by preference; it is
always best to have the sun at one’s back.</p>

<p>Avoid macadam roads&mdash;except when country
roads are muddy, or on a night walk. By night
smooth footing is especially advantageous. Macadam
is wearing to both body and mind&mdash;and
sole leather; immediately after rain it is tolerable.
Avoid highways, seek byways. Leave even
the byways at times, and travel across country.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Maps</span></h4>

<p>On map making, see <a href="#Page_111">page 111</a>.</p>

<p>A map is useful, and, on an extended tour, almost
necessary. Topographic maps, showing
towns and roads also, of a large part of the
United States are published by the United States
Geological Survey. Better maps could not be desired.
Different regions are mapped to different
scale, but, for the greater part, each map or
“quadrangle” covers an area measuring 15′
in extent each way; the scale is 1:62,500, or about
a mile to an inch. Each quadrangle measures
approximately 12¾ × 17½ inches and displays an
area of 210-225 square miles, the area varying
with the latitude. To traverse one quadrangle
from south to north means, if the country be hilly
and the roads winding, to walk twenty miles or
more.</p>

<p>On these maps water is printed in blue, contour
lines in brown, and cultural features&mdash;roads,
towns, county lines&mdash;in black. A contour line is
a line which follows the surface at a fixed altitude;
one who follows a contour line will go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
neither uphill nor down, but on the level. The
contour interval, that is, the difference in elevation
between adjacent contour lines, is stated at
the bottom of each quadrangle. It is not uniform
for all the areas mapped, and is greater in mountains
and less in level regions. Every fourth or
fifth contour line is made heavier than the
others.</p>

<p>A little experience will teach one to read a contour
map at a glance; the shape of the hills is
indicated, and their steepness. In addition,
these maps bear in figures (and in feet) actual
elevations above sea level.</p>

<p>Besides the quadrangles on the unit of area
mentioned, the Survey publishes maps to larger
scale, of regions of exceptional importance:
Boston and vicinity, for instance; Washington
and vicinity; the Gettysburg battlefield; the
Niagara gorge; Glacier National Park; industrial
regions such as Franklin Furnace, N. J., and
vicinity.</p>

<p>Application may be made to The Director,
United States Geological Survey, Washington,
D. C., for an index map of any particular region
in which one is interested; the index map is
marked off into quadrangles, and each quadrangle
bears its distinctive name. Information regarding
larger maps is also given. So that, on consulting
the index map, one may order by name
the particular quadrangles or larger maps he may
desire. The price of the quadrangles is ten cents
each, or six cents each for fifty or more. The
larger maps units are of varying price.</p>

<p>For remoter regions, not yet mapped by Government,
ruder maps may ordinarily be had.</p>

<p>Such foreign regions as the Alps are, of course,
perfectly mapped. The maps in Baedeker’s guidebooks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
are good, and better still may be had, if
one desires.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to have the maps of one’s
home region mounted on linen and shellaced.</p>

<p><em>Map case.</em> Maps of small size and constantly
in use may be put in form for carrying by cutting
them into sections and mounting them on linen,
with spaces for folding left between the edges of
adjacent sections. A map so mounted may be
folded and carried in an oiled silk envelope.
Leather is not a satisfactory material for such a
case, for, when carried in one’s clothing, it becomes
wet through with perspiration.</p>

<p>For a walk on which one has occasion to use a
number of maps, it is preferable to provide oneself
with a cylindrical case of sheet tin, in which
the rolled maps may be contained. A suitable
case for the Geological Survey quadrangles measures
eighteen inches in length and two in diameter.
A close-fitting lid slips over the open
end, and there are runners soldered to one side,
through which a supporting strap may pass. A
small hole in the bottom facilitates the putting
on and removal of the lid. Any tinsmith can
make such a case in a short time. It should be
painted outside. It may be suspended by a strap
from the shoulders, and so be easily accessible,
or it may, if preferred, be secured to or carried
within the knapsack.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Walking by Compass</span></h4>

<p>Where roads are many and villages frequent,
one may easily find his way, map in hand. But
in the wilderness the map must be supplemented
by the compass. The beginner should go gradually
about this matter of traveling by compass;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
he should gain experience in small undertakings.
For one acquainted with the art, there is in its
practice an alluring element of novelty and adventure.
Most of all, one needs to teach himself
to rely on his compass <em>implicitly</em>.</p>

<p>A few suggestions about walking by compass
may be useful. <em>First</em>, study the map, and note
the objective points; <em>second</em>, on setting out, have
always a definite point in mind and know its exact
bearing; refer to the compass repeatedly, directing
one’s course to a tree, rock shoulder, or other
landmark, and on reaching it, appeal to the compass
again, to define a new mark; <em>third</em>, in making
detours, around bogs or cliffs, use the wits,
and make proper compensation; <em>finally</em>, and as
has once been said, but cannot be too often said,
trust the compass.</p>

<p>From a mountain top, if the destination can
be seen, one may study the contour of the land
between and, engraving it surely in mind, direct
his course accordingly. But ability to do this is
gained only through long experience. For a
novice to attempt it were foolhardy, and might
lead to serious consequences.</p>

<p>In making mental note of landmarks, one
should, so far as possible, get <em>two aligned points</em>
on the course ahead, for by keeping the alignment
deviation may be corrected.</p>

<p>On a clear day, having laid one’s course, one
may follow it by the guidance of one’s shadow.
But here again, some experience is needed, before
trusting one’s ability too far.</p>

<p>One’s watch may serve as a rude compass, remembering
that at sunrise (approximately in the
east and approximately at six o’clock) <em>the watch
being set to sun time</em>, if the watch be so placed
that the hour hand points to the sun, the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and south line will lie across the dial, from the
three o’clock index number to nine. And at any
succeeding time of the day, if the hour hand be
pointed to the sun, south will lie midway between
the point where the hour hand lies and the index
number twelve. Manifestly, this improvised compass
can be exactly right only at equinox, and
only when the watch is set to meridian time.</p>

<h3>IV<br />
<span class="smaller">WALKING CLUBS IN AMERICA</span></h3>

<p>The walking clubs of Europe have had a long
and useful history. The favored regions, particularly
the Alps, the Bavarian highlands, and the
Black Forest, have, time out of mind, been the
holiday land for all the European peoples. Walking
there is in vogue as nowhere else in the
world, unless it be among the English lakes. Before
the war it was interesting to an American
visitor in the Tyrol to observe how many people
spent their holidays afoot&mdash;and how many sorts
of people: men, women, old, young. Sometimes
one met whole families walking together. It was
not a surprising thing to encounter a fresh-cheeked
schoolgirl on the peak of the Wildspitze;
and pedestrian bridal tours seemed to be, in some
strata of society at least, quite the thing. But
the impressive fact was that there were hundreds
of people&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;tramping
the mountains together, and finding the inseparable
desiderata, health and happiness.</p>

<p>This enthusiasm for walking has expressed
itself in walking clubs; they are part of the
“Movement”: The Alpine Club, <i lang="fr">Le Club Alpin
Français</i>, <i lang="it">Il Club Alpino Italiano</i>, <i lang="de">Die Deutsche
und Oesterreiche Alpenverein</i>, <i lang="de">Der Schweize
Alpenclub</i>, etc. These clubs lay trails and blaze
them, through chasms, across passes, and to summits.
(It is the pedestrian alone to whom the
mountains reveal their extremest beauties.) The
clubs maintain, at comfortable intervals, mountain
huts, where one may find simple food and
a clean bed; and they prepare and publish maps
and guidebooks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>We are followers of the Europeans, and we
have this advantage of followers, that we may
see and profit by all that they have done.</p>

<p>Already there are many walking clubs in
America; their memberships are greatest, as
might be expected, in New England and on the
Pacific Coast. Some of these organizations are
concerned chiefly with feats of mountaineering;
others with the needs of the greater number of
ordinary people. It is of the clubs of this latter
class that some account will here be given. But
at the outset a word of apology is needed. The
data from which this chapter is prepared are in
the necessity of the case casually collected; it
cannot be otherwise than that they are fragmentary;
and the result must be faulty and ill
proportioned. The chapter is offered as a provisional
one. Organizations not mentioned, but
which might have had place with those which
are, are requested to furnish data respecting
themselves; all interested are invited to note mistakes
and give advice of corrections, to the end
that a more useful and more nearly satisfactory
chapter may ultimately appear. Communications
may be addressed to the League of Walkers, 347
Madison Avenue, New York.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Appalachian Mountain Club</span></h4>

<p>One of the oldest and the most distinguished
of the walking clubs of America, is the Appalachian
Mountain Club, of Boston, with its two outlying
“chapters,” in New York, and in Worcester,
Mass. Following is the official statement of the
Club’s objects and activities.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Appalachian Mountain Club was organized
in Boston in January, 1876, to ‘explore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
mountains of New England and the adjacent regions,
both for scientific and artistic purposes.’
Its activities are directed not only toward the
preservation of the natural beauty of our mountain
resorts,&mdash;and in particular their forests,&mdash;but
also toward making them still more accessible
and enjoyable through the building of paths and
camps, the publishing of maps and guidebooks,
the collecting of scientific data, and the conducting
of numerous field excursions.</p>

<p>“In the fulfilment of its main purpose it has
built and maintained over two hundred miles of
trails, three stone huts and nine open log shelters,
all in the White Mountains, and a clubhouse
on Three Mile Island in Lake Winnepesaukee.
It has also acquired sixteen reservations, held
purely in trust for the benefit of the public, in
New Hampshire, Maine, and Massachusetts. It
annually conducts four long excursions: one in
February for snowshoeing, one in July, one in
August, for those who prefer camp life, and one
in early autumn, besides the same number of
shorter trips in February, May, early September,
and at Christmas. These are mainly in New
England and New York. In addition there are
Saturday afternoon walks to various points of
interest in the country around Boston and New
York City, the latter under the New York Chapter.
Occasionally there are special walks for
those interested in natural history. Those wishing
to go farther afield can obtain privileges in
connection with the annual outings of the western
mountaineering clubs.</p>

<p>“From October to May monthly meetings are
held in Boston and to these members may invite
friends. In connection with these meetings illustrated
lectures are given upon mountain regions
and other outdoor subjects of interest.</p>

<p>“Clubrooms are maintained in the Tremont
Building [in Boston], where committee meetings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and small informal gatherings are held, and
where the fine library, many maps, and a large
collection of photographs are kept.…</p>

<p>“Members are kept informed of the activities
of the Club by a monthly Bulletin, and at least
once a year an illustrated magazine, entitled <cite>Appalachia</cite>,
is published.… In addition the
Club has published a ‘Guide to Paths in the
White Mountains and Adjacent Regions’ ($2.00),
a ‘Bibliography of the White Mountains’ ($1.00),
‘Walks and Rides about Boston’ ($1.25), a booklet
‘Equipment for Climbing and Camping’ (10
cents), and a ‘Snowshoe Manual’ (10 cents).</p>

<p>“In January, 1919, there were about 2300 members
(the New York Chapter numbers 145).
Membership in the Club costs eight dollars for
the first year and four dollars a year thereafter.
No climbing qualification is necessary, but candidates
must be nominated by two club members,
to whom they are personally known, and approved
by the Committee on Membership. Application
blanks and further information may be had by
addressing the Corresponding Secretary, 1050
Tremont Building, Boston.”</p>

</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Green Mountain Club</span></h4>

<p>The Green Mountain Club, of Vermont, was
organized March 11, 1910, with the object of
making the remotest and wildest regions of the
Green Mountains accessible to pedestrians. As
rapidly as its income permits, it is building the
Long Trail, which when completed will be a “skyline”
trail for walkers, following the mountain
ridges and ascending the peaks, throughout a
course of about 250 miles, from the Canadian line
to Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Two portions of the trail have already been
built and are in use: one, a stretch of thirty miles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
extending north and south near Rutland; the
other, a continuous section of sixty-seven miles,
extending from Middlebury Gap, fourteen miles
east of Middlebury, northward, to Smugglers’
Notch, on the east side of Mount Mansfield. It
requires eight days to cover this section of the
Trail. There is a cabin of the Club, or a clubhouse,
farmhouse, or hotel available at the end
of each day’s hike. It is better to carry food
and blankets, though blankets may be hired and
food sent in under arrangements made in advance.
There is good prospect that by the end
of the summer (of 1919) new trails will be built,
connecting the two portions mentioned, and extending
the northern stretch some miles further,
to Johnson. The Club will then have built and
brought under its care 130 miles of continuous
trail.</p>

<p>Some account of walking the Long Trail may
be found in “Vacation Tramps in New England
Highlands,” by Allen Chamberlain.</p>

<p>The dues of the Club are $1.00 a year; the
membership exceeds 600. There are several sections
or branches, each of which has charge of
the construction and maintenance of a section of
the Long Trail.</p>

<p>The Burlington Section in the course of the
year holds a number of outings in the vicinity of
Burlington, and conducts two or three trips into
the mountains. On Washington’s Birthday, each
year it makes a trip, either to Mount Mansfield
or to the Couching Lion.</p>

<p>The New York Section, organized in 1916, has
212 members. It conducts many half-day, full-day,
and week-end outings in the vicinity of New
York City, and an occasional excursion to the
Green Mountains. During the year 1918-1919, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
addition to the activities indicated, it gave three
social reunions with camp fire suppers, four illustrated
lectures, conducted a pilgrimage to the
home of John Burroughs, and held a membership
dinner at a New York hotel.</p>

<p>For information regarding the Long Trail, advice
about shelters, for maps, and for suggestions
regarding particular hikes, write to the Corresponding
Secretary, 6 Masonic Temple, Burlington,
Vt.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The American Alpine Club</span></h4>

<p>The American Alpine Club requires the highest
qualifications for membership of any walking
club. Its one hundred members come from all
parts of the country. An annual dinner is given
in Boston, New York, or Philadelphia. The address
of the secretary is 2029 Q St., Washington,
D. C.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Walking Clubs of New York</span></h4>

<p>Mr. Albert Handy is the historian of the walking
clubs of New York, and his account of them
is, with his generous permission, here given. It
appeared first in the New York <cite>Evening Post
Saturday Magazine</cite>, for May 6, 1916, and has
been revised for the purposes of this handbook.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first walking club in America of which
any record is found was the little Alpine Club
organized by some of the professors at Williamstown,
Mass., which came into being about 1863
and went out of being a few years later. But
before its demise Mr. and Mrs. Henry E. Buermeyer
and William B. (better known as ‘Father
Bill’) Curtiss had formed the habit of exploring
the wilds of Staten Island or the highlands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Hudson&mdash;there were no developments then, and
it was a wilderness&mdash;on Sundays. ‘Father Bill’
Curtis was the premier athlete of America and
the founder of the New York Athletic Club. Mrs.
Buermeyer was one of the first women to ride a
bicycle in this country, and Mr. Buermeyer was
a noted swimmer.</p>

<p>“This little group constituted the beginnings of
the Fresh Air Club, which is today the oldest
walking club in New York, and which can alone
contest the claim of the Appalachian Mountain
Club to the premiership of the United States.
Shortly after its foundation the winged-foot
organization sent a score of its members on these
walks and Mrs. Buermeyer dropped out. Later
some members of the old American Athletic Club,
in conjunction with others from the Manhattan
Athletic Club, developed a walking cult, and for a
time pedestrianism seemed destined to become a
popular pastime. In this group was E. Berry
Wall, whose name is associated with dancing
rather than athletics in the minds of the majority
of New Yorkers.</p>

<p>“Then interest diminished gradually until each
organization furnished but a negligible number
of walkers. Followed something in the nature of
a renaissance, the two groups consolidated, and
the present Fresh Air Club came into being.</p>

<p>“In the early eighties interest in athletics increased,
there were organized baseball clubs, tennis
clubs, cricket clubs, but for a long period the
Fresh Air Club was the only organization devoted
to walking, with the exception of the Westchester
Walking Club, otherwise known as the
Westchester Hare and Hounds (whose members
were recruited from the then prosperous but
long since defunct Harlem Athletic Club), which
rose, flourished, and decayed, leaving its spirit
and traditions to be carried by the Fresh Air
Club, which in February, 1890, was incorporated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“What the Appalachian Mountain Club did for
New Hampshire the Fresh Air Club did for the
country within a fifty-mile radius of New York;
there is not a section of northern New Jersey, or
of Rockland, Westchester, or Orange County,
which has not been explored by some of its members.
On Friday of each week during the tramping
season ‘Father Bill’ who was official pathfinder,
would go over the route of the walk projected
for the following Sunday, when necessary
blazing a trail, so that the party might proceed
without any delay or casting about for the right
road, until finally the paths up Storm King, Bear
Mountain&mdash;there wasn’t any Interstate Park
then&mdash;Anthony’s Nose, and the highlands of the
Hudson became as familiar to him as the path
to his own door.…</p>

<p>“Today the Club has about seventy-five members,
of whom some forty are active. Its walking
season extends from October to December and
from March to June, and walks are scheduled for
all Sundays and holidays, to a few of which women
friends of members are invited. During the winter
months skating excursions, when weather
conditions are favorable, are substituted for
walking. The Fresh Air Club does not seek an
increase in membership; in fact, a member remarked
to the writer that it did not desire publicity
or even a considerable amount of inquiry
from would-be candidates for membership. Its
bulletin states:</p>

<p>“‘That its constitution, by-laws, and rules have
not been, and will not be, published; that it accepts
no members who are not good cross-country
walkers, and that membership can be
obtained only after personal acquaintance and
such participation in the excursions of the Club
as is needed to prove the candidate’s fitness and
ability.… Participation by non-members
in the excursions of the Club is by invitation
only.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“As a veracious chronicler it becomes incumbent
upon me to here set down that during its long
existence of nearly half a century it has exercised
practically no influence and has never attained
a place in the sun as a constructive factor in the
encouragement of general walking, although its
object, according to its certificate of incorporation,
is the ‘encouragement and promotion of outdoor
sport for health and pleasure.’</p>

<p>“The year 1911 was momentous in the history
of walking. Outdoor life was enjoying a popular
boom; for this condition the motor car and the
country club were in large measure responsible.
The open-air enthusiast found a ready hearing,
his preachments falling upon fertile ground. In
this year a little group of about ten walkers
organized the Walkers’ Club of America, and almost
simultaneously Charles G. Bullard, of the
Appalachian Mountain Club, established a New
York branch of that organization, the membership
being drawn principally from the members
of the Boston Club residing in or near this city.
Prominent among the organizers of the Walkers’
Club was James H. Hocking, one of the most
enthusiastic pedestrians in this country, and one
who believes that walking will cure most of the
ills to which mind and body are heir. This
organization was opposed to hiding its light
under a bushel; its conception of its functions
was thoroughly democratic; its primary purpose
was to induce the largest number of people possible
to use their legs in the way that God intended
that they should.</p>

<p>“Now, while walking could scarcely be said to
be attaining widespread popularity, there was in
the ensuing year or two a steady growth in interest.
A walking organization was formed by
some of the members of the Crescent Athletic
Club in conjunction with the Union League Club,
also of the ‘city of homes and churches,’ and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
programme of Sunday walks was prepared. But
it was in 1913 that the actual recrudescence in
walking occurred, when the <cite>Evening Post</cite> and
the <cite>Times</cite> gave considerable space to articles on
walking. In the late winter of that year, too,
there began to appear inconspicuous paragraphs
on the sporting pages of the Monday morning
papers to the effect that on the previous day members
of the Walkers’ Club had hiked from City
Hall to Coney Island, or perhaps from St. George
to New Dorp or from Columbus Circle to
Hastings.</p>

<p>“The schedule time of the Coney Island walk,
for the novice squad, to be completed before
noon, was about two hours and a half. And the
average New Yorker, who regards a long sleep
and a good breakfast on Sunday mornings as his
inalienable rights, gazed gloomily at these items,
and then turned to an account of a murder or a
break in the stockmarket, anything in fact radiating
a more cheerful influence. Even the enthusiastic
golfer sighed to himself as he thanked
God that he was not as some other man.</p>

<p>“It was in 1913, too, that the Ladies’ Walking
Club, affiliated with the Walkers’ Club of America,
was organized, but it has never had many
members or attained any marked degree of popularity.
Prior, however, to its formation, the
Alumnæ Committee on Athletics of Barnard College
prepared a programme of intercollegiate
outings for Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays,
which included several pleasant hikes; and these
attracted a much greater number of participants
than did the events of the Ladies’ Walking Club.</p>

<p>“Under the impetus derived from the Walkers’
Club several of the evening high schools formed
pedestrian organizations which turned out with
the parent body. One of the morning newspapers
offered century medals, which seems to have materially
stimulated interest, and by the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of 1915 there were six or eight schools that sent
out their squads of hikers every Sunday.</p>

<p>“It was early in 1915 that the Walkers’ Club,
with a membership of over two hundred, was
incorporated. Shortly thereafter a schism arose
in its ranks, which resulted in the birth of the
American Walkers’ Association. At a meeting
of the Walkers’ Club, held in June, seven members
withdrew. Within a week twelve men had
formed the Walkers’ Association, which was almost
immediately incorporated. Of the split it
may be said that it was deplorable, and beyond
that its history must occupy a blank page in the
annals of American walking.</p>

<p>“The Walkers’ Association immediately began
an aggressive campaign to secure members. It
adopted a small emblem which the majority of
the one hundred and twenty men on its rolls wear.
It also adopted the walking associations of most
of the evening high schools, as well as all promising
material which it could discover. Finally
it organized a women’s branch with a schedule
of walks of its own. It points with pride to a
membership of over 135, a record of 17,856 miles
covered by members on its hikes, so that if a
message had been relayed it might have crossed
the continent five times; to one hike on which
107 men turned out, and to another&mdash;not the
same hike&mdash;when fifty miles was covered in a
day.</p>

<p>“The walks of the Walkers’ Club and the
Walkers’ Association invariably start from New
York, and up to the present time have invariably
been along the high roads which the pedestrian
must share, in unequal distribution, with the
motorcar and other vehicles. A speed of four to
six miles an hour is maintained and the walks
vary from ten to fifty miles in length. The
walkers are divided into squads, graded according
to speed and the distance to be covered. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
hikes of the Fresh Air Club, on the other hand,
start from some point reached by train, twenty
to forty miles from New York, and the trail leads
through the woods and over the hills, through
streams and bogs and over rocks and fallen trees,
with an occasional stretch of road as an incident
to the walk.</p>

<p>“Like the Walkers’ Club it has a schedule, and
where the going is good a speed of four miles or
better is maintained. The walks terminate at a
railway station which must be reached before
train time. The Appalachians, however,
saunter, they rarely exceed ten miles on their
local tramps, they proceed leisurely cross country,
if they see a hill that appeals to them they
climb it and enjoy the view, or they linger on the
shores of some lake. The Club walks are all held
on Saturday afternoons and holidays, Sunday
walking being mildly disapproved.</p>

<p>“As a purely constructive factor in the development
of pedestrianism in the eastern United
States, the Walkers’ Club and Walkers’ Association
probably lead. Other clubs have conceived
theories&mdash;ideals, perhaps&mdash;these organizations
have created pedestrians. Their walking season
extends from the 21st of June to the 22nd of December,
and from the 22nd of December to the
21st of June. Both clubs have trained people to
walk. An officer of one of them once remarked
to the writer that fifty per cent of the members
did not know how to use their legs.</p>

<p>“The Walkers’ Club has to its credit an extended
list of activities. It fathered the evening high
schools’ walking movement; it inaugurated a
campaign of publicity; it has through Pathfinder
Hocking planned walks of from one day to one
week for individuals and groups; it has done
much to raise pedestrianism from its low estate
to an equality with other sports and the end is not
yet. ‘Hocking,’ said a member of a rival organization,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
‘has done more for walking than any
other man in America, but&mdash;’ and the rest of the
sentence I have transferred to that unpublished
page in the annals of walking on which the recording
secretary spilled his ink.</p>

<p>“A few years ago the Walkers’ Association
mapped out a most elaborate program. With the
consummation of its plans, however, the war materially
interfered. It was intended to create a
large number of walking squads. There was to
be a squad for the ‘tired business man’&mdash;that
variety of the genus homo of whom we read
much and whom we never see; a cross-country
squad, which would take tramps similar to the
hikes of the Fresh Air Club; an afternoon squad
for the man who desired to spend his Sunday
mornings in dreams; and any other kind of squad
that anyone might desire to suggest.</p>

<p>“It planned the establishment of affiliated clubs
in other cities, and ultimately an organization
which would in some respects resemble the <i lang="de">Wandervogel</i>,
the great national pedestrian body of
Germany. At the present time it has a prosperous
branch at Cleveland with a membership in
excess of five hundred.</p>

<p>“In the meantime, before a consummation of
their more ambitious plans can be hoped for,
much less realized, it were well if a federation
of all the walking clubs in New York was perfected,
with a common headquarters, where maps
and data of much value might be made available
to all hikers, and where frequent gatherings
might be held for the interchange of ideas and
experiences. And to the attainment of this object
the Walkers’ Association may well address
itself.”</p>

</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Wanderlust</span></h4>

<p>“Wanderlust” is the appellative under which
Saturday afternoon walks in the vicinity of Philadelphia
are organized. They have been conducted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
for now ten years. Schedules of walks
are published quarterly in advance, and the leaflets
bear this advertisement:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These walks are arranged for the general
public. There are no fees, dues nor other requirements.
Everyone is welcome, on one walk
or all. All that is necessary is to be at the starting
place at the time appointed. The only cost
is that of carfare. The walks are all about five
miles, and often include some points of interest,
although no special effort is made by the leaders
toward that aim. No fast walking is done, as
new people come each week, and might not be
able to keep up. The whole aim of the walks is
to get people out into the open, to learn how even
a simple exercise like walking can mean strength
and health for those who seek it, and pleasure
for all.… Copies [of this announcement]
will be mailed only to those who send a stamped,
addressed envelope to any active member of the
Committee, or to the Secretary.”</p>

</div>

<p>The secretary (address 351 East Chelton Avenue,
Germantown, Pa.) writes (June 13, 1919):</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Wanderlust goes on about the same as it
has done since 1910, though our numbers have
been much smaller during and since the war.
So many of our followers were engaged in war
work, or working overtime, that we noticed their
absence very much. For many years our average
was about fifty, but for the past two years
it has been around thirty.</p>

<p>“We have two classes of walkers, the regulars,
many of whom have been along from the start,
and the irregulars, who come from one to a
dozen times, and seem to drop away for no reason
we can learn. Many people come once and never
again, probably disappointed to find the walkers
a happy lot, who apparently need little to satisfy
them. That conclusion we arrived at after hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
their remarks on many occasions. But the
critics were not ‘hikers’ and did not have the
spirit.</p>

<p>“About the permanence of such an undertaking,
I can only say that I feel sure we have lasted so
long because we avoided any form or attempt at
organization, and kept it a free-for-all-come-once-or-always
outing party.</p>

<p>“We profited by the mistakes of some other
cities, where they organized, with the usual factional
rivalry, and breaking-up of the club, and
in another case, the growth of an exclusive club,
shutting out many who could not afford to continue.
So we have fought all attempts (on the
part of a few) to organize in any way. Of course
that means that someone must head the committee
and volunteer to be the secretary or chairman.
Being an assistant to the Director of Physical
Education, I was asked to take charge of the
Wanderlust about eight years ago and am still a
willing secretary, and believe that by keeping the
hike under the Department we are keeping it
from breaking up or changing into a less desirable
form. Our aim is to give an opportunity to
grown people to get some of the physical training
and efficiency that the school children get in our
schools, and at the same time to encourage outdoor
‘play’ for young and old.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately this year our Board felt unable
to bear the small expense necessary, so we are
charging a small sum for the announcements and
so far have been able to be self-supporting. But
it is not in keeping with our ‘free’ policy, and
we hope soon to do away with the charges, small
as they are.”</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Pittsburgh Health Club</span></h4>

<p>This organization, now fifteen years old, conducts
weekly walks. The secretary’s address is
249 Martsolf Ave., Pittsburgh, Pa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Prairie Club</span></h4>

<p>The Prairie Club, of Chicago, was organized in
1908 by a committee of the Playground Association
of Chicago as “Saturday Afternoon Walks.”
It was incorporated in 1911 as “The Prairie
Club.” The objects of the club are: “The promotion
of outdoor recreation in the form of
walks and outings, camping, and canoeing; the
encouragement of the love of nature and the dissemination
of knowledge of the attractions of the
country adjacent to the city of Chicago and of
the Central West; and the preservation of those
regions in which such outdoor recreation may be
pursued.” There are three kinds of memberships:
active, associate, and honorary. The initiation
fee for active membership is $2.00, and
the annual dues are $2.00. The club maintains a
Beach House and Camp, situated in the heart of
the Indiana dunes, on the south shore of Lake
Michigan, 47 miles from Chicago, the privileges
of which are available to active members of the
club and their guests. The club also publishes
an attractive monthly bulletin. During the year
1918 the club conducted 42 Saturday afternoon
walks, 8 all-day walks, 4 week-end outings, and 1
extended outing. Up to March, 1919, the club
reported 645 active members.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Sierra Club</span></h4>

<p>The Sierra Club, of San Francisco, California,
is the largest of American pedestrian clubs, with
a membership of more than 2,000. It was founded
in 1892, and was further distinguished in having
as its president, until his death (in 1914), John
Muir. Its purposes are defined in these words:</p>

<p>“To explore, enjoy, and render accessible the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
mountain regions of the Pacific Coast; to publish
authentic information concerning them; to enlist
the support and cooperation of the people and the
Government in preserving the forests and other
natural features of the Sierra Nevada.”</p>

<p>The annual dues of the Club are $3 (for the
first year, $5). The club headquarters are at
402 Mills Building, San Francisco. A Southern
California Section of the Club exists, and advice
concerning it may be had of its chairman, address
315 West Third Street, Los Angeles.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Mountaineers</span></h4>

<p>The following note has been furnished by the
secretary of the organization:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To explore and study the mountains, forests,
and water courses of the Northwest; to gather
into permanent form the history and traditions
of this region; to preserve, by protective legislation
or otherwise, the natural beauty of north-western
America; to make expeditions into these
regions in fulfilment of the above purposes; to
encourage a spirit of good-fellowship among all
lovers of outdoor life&mdash;these were the avowed
purposes for which a group of nature lovers met
in Seattle in January, 1907, and organized The
Mountaineers. Since then, the membership has
expanded to over half a thousand, and knows no
geographical bounds. Nearly a hundred men and
women contributed themselves in the recent war,
while those at home rendered active service in
collecting sphagnum moss, making surgical dressings,
and otherwise trying to do their part.
Branches have been organized, property acquired,
permanent funds established, and the Club has
now become one of the worthwhile organizations
of the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>“Summer outings and the snowshoe trip to
Mt. Rainier with which the Club welcomes in each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
new year are the most striking of its activities.
For three weeks each summer a hobnailed, khaki-clad
party of from fifty to one hundred men and
women enjoy a well planned hike into some mountainous
region, and usually climb some famous
peak. Mt. Rainier, Mt. Adams, Mt. Olympus,
Glacier Peak, Mt. Stewart, Mt. St. Helens, and
many others have been climbed once or more.
Glacier National Park, as well as our own Monte
Cristo region, has also been visited.</p>

<p>“With pack trains, hired packers, and professional
cooks along, little of the unpleasant work
of camping falls on the members, yet, with each
individual’s dunnage limited to thirty-five pounds,
and with frequent shifting of camps and plenty
of snow and rock work, genuine outing experience
is afforded. The leadership is wholly by
members, and every precaution is taken for the
safety of the party.</p>

<p>“The snowshoe trip to Mt. Rainier in midwinter
must be taken to be comprehended. Paradise
Valley in summer is brilliant with its mountain
flowers, but in winter it is enchantingly somber
with its deep-laid snow, through which emerge
the conical trees with their symmetry of drooping
branches peculiar to the snow-laden conifers.
Snowshoeing, skiing, tobogganing, and climbing
afford ample exercise, while the hotel (usually
approached through a snow tunnel) with its comfortable
beds and provisions brought up in summer
time, relieves the party of the usual hardships
of winter trips. In the evenings, before
the big fireplaces, vaudeville performances, circuses,
and other entertainments rival similar affairs
held in the evenings of the summer outings.</p>

<p>“Winter and summer trips are taken to Snoqualmie
Lodge, a large log structure built by the
Club near the backbone of the Cascade Range,
but easily accessible both to railroad and highway,
as well as to rugged mountains like Chair
Peak and Silver Tip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“A wholly different region may be enjoyed at
the Club’s Rhododendron Park, a large area
across Puget Sound, brilliant each May with a
profusion of the white and pink of the state
flower. The Club is planning the construction
of a cabin in the mountains near Everett, and
also one near Tacoma.</p>

<p>“Lecturers are procured for monthly meetings,
a collection of slides maintained of the mountains
visited by the Club, botany and other sciences
pursued, and the results of each year’s activities
summarized in an annual publication. A bulletin
is also published forecasting each month’s activities.</p>

<p>“Beneficial as the foregoing may be, the greatest
service to the greatest number is afforded
by what are prosaically known as ‘local walks.’
On each of two or three Sundays of the month
a committee in charge has carefully planned a
hike of from eight to twenty miles by road, trail,
or beach. As many as two hundred persons have
sometimes gone on one of these trips. Stenographers,
teachers, clerks, professors, nurses,
lawyers, doctors, men and women, are taken from
the cramped atmosphere of offices, schoolrooms,
and hospitals out into the freedom of the wild, to
breathe the fresh sea air, and to acquire that
physical health and hearty mien which are such
stimulants to the growth of character.”</p>

<h3>V<br />
<span class="smaller">ORGANIZATION AND CONDUCT OF WALKING CLUBS</span></h3>

<p>Those who live reasonably near the home or
field of existing clubs are urged to relate themselves
to them. Don’t organize hastily. Be sure,
first, of two things: that a fair-sized continuing
membership is to be expected, to be advantaged
by a club; and, second, that, in the multiplicity
of already existing societies, there is place for
another. Remember that the persons who will
be interested and whose interest and support are
desired, will in large part be persons already giving
much time to altruistic activity. Think this
matter through, taking advice of persons of experience
and judgment. It may be better, in a
given case, to widen the activities of some existing
organization&mdash;canoe club, perhaps, or Audubon
Society&mdash;than to form a new one. Pedestrianism
may well have place in the program of school,
Y. M. C. A., or Boy Scout Troop. But of this
something will be said in the sequel. In a city,
however, a walking club may well stand on its
own feet; and, in such a favored region as the
Green Mountains, for example, to organize a
walking club comes near to being a public duty.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Activities of a Walking Club</span></h4>

<p>Before opening a discussion of the formalities
of organization, it will be well to consider what
the normal activities of a walking club are; for
to the end in view the machinery of organization,
simple or complex, should be adapted. The activities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of a club may be regarded as of two sorts,
and, in lieu of better terms, may be designated
as primary and secondary. Primary activities
concern the actual business of walking: development
of the pedestrian resources of some particular
region, trail making, map making, publishing
of data, maintaining a bureau, conducting
hikes, affording instruction, and contributing
seriously to the growing literature of pedestrianism.
Secondary activities consist in conducting
dinners and other social entertainment, in providing
illustrated lectures on travel, popular science,
and kindred subjects. There is need of
care, to keep such activities in their proper secondary
place. The primary activities require
further consideration.</p>

<h5><i>Development of the Pedestrian Resources of
Some Particular Region</i></h5>

<p>This should be an aim of every walking club.
The region to be developed will in many&mdash;in most
cases, indeed&mdash;be the region about home. Clubs
in large cities, however, and clubs situated in
regions not suitable for walking, may well turn
attention, wholly or in part, to regions far from
home. The mountainous parts of a continent are
the natural recreation grounds for the whole
people, and those who live far away may still
have their proper share in making these parts
more readily available. In the Alps, the pedestrian
is pleased to find the lodges where he stops
at night called by the names of distant cities,
whose citizens maintain them&mdash;<i lang="de">Breslauerhütte</i>,
for example, or <i lang="de">Dusseldorferhütte</i>. In this country,
too, the Green Mountain Club (see <a href="#Page_84">page 84</a>)
has its New York Section; and to the New York
Section it has allotted a certain portion of the
Long Trail (a length of fifty miles). The New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
York club, accordingly, while not neglectful of
pedestrianism at home, opens, develops, and
maintains its part of the route in Vermont, and
conducts annually a hike in that region.</p>

<p>The development of a region involves observation
and putting into communicable form the results
of observation, and it may and ordinarily
does involve further a greater or less amount of
physical preparation. First of all, the region
must be traversed, and that again and again,
under varying conditions of season and climate,
and thus thoroughly known. Maps, if available,
must be carefully studied, and particular attention
must be given to distances, steepness of
roads, and to the nature of the footing&mdash;whether
the way be rough or smooth, hard or soft, wet
or dry. Note should be made of obstructions,
such as briars, fallen trees, and unbridged
streams. The possibility of using railways and
trolley lines to widen the available area should
not be forgotten. Hotels should be noted, and
restaurants, and farmhouses, where rest and refreshment
may be had; and, in the wilderness,
camp sites should be selected.</p>

<p>Observation should next be directed to such
natural resources as may engage the attention
and interest of the pedestrian: scenery, of course,
hilltops, waterfalls, and such matters; then to
plant and animal life, and that with the interests
of sportsmen and lovers of natural science particularly
in mind. Attention should be given to
geology and to mineral deposits. Then the history
of the region should be studied, its traditions
learned, and its monuments considered&mdash;distinctive
and characteristic matters touching
the life of the people, industries, factories, public
works, and buildings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>All of these matters should be taken into account,
with a view to making the results of
observation and study generally available.</p>

<h5><i>Trail Making</i></h5>

<p>“Of trail making there are three stages. There
is dreaming the trail, there is prospecting the
trail, there is making the trail. Of the first one
can say nothing&mdash;dreams are fragile, intangible.
Prospecting the trail&mdash;there lies perhaps the
greatest of the joys of trail work. It has a suggestion
of the thrill of exploration. No one of
us but loves still to play explorer. And here
there is just a bit of the real thing to keep the
play going. Picking the trail route over forested
ridges calls for every bit of the skill gained in
our years of tramping. There is never time to
go it slow, to explore every possibility. Usually
there is one hasty day to lay out the line for a
week’s work. For a basis there is the look of
the region, from some distant point, from a summit
climbed last year, perhaps. For a help, there
is the compass, but in our hill country we use it
little. Partly we go by imperfect glimpses from
trees climbed, from blow-down edges, from small
cliffs&mdash;but chiefly we feel the run of the land, its
lift and slope and direction. The string from
the grocer’s cone unwinds behind&mdash;an easy way
of marking and readily obliterated when we go
wrong. We pay little heed to small difficulties,
those are for the trail makers to solve. Only a
wide blow-down, a bad ledge, a mistake in general
direction, cause us to double back a bit and
start afresh.…</p>

<p>“Making trail is the more plodding work; yet
has reliefs and pleasures of its own. Each day,
as the gang works along the string line, problems
of detail arise. Ours is no gang of uninterested
hirelings. If the line makes a suspicious bend,
the prospectors have to explain or correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>.…
Decision made, the gang scatters along the line,
each to a rod or two, for we find working together
is not efficient.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>”</p>

<p>As has already been said, a club ordinarily will
find occasion to do some work of physical preparation
of its pedestrian routes. Highways are
ordinarily beyond control, but byways are not.
The opening of trails, cutting away of briars and
windfalls, making the footing sure for a man
under a pack, the building of footways and handrails
in dangerous places, the cleaning of springs
and providing water basins and troughs, the
marking of trails&mdash;all these matters are such
as manifestly should engage a club’s energies.</p>

<p>Trail making is by no means a simple matter.
The successful trail-maker (and trails should be
successfully made) must be expert in woodcraft;
he must understand topography&mdash;the “lay of the
land”; he must know from what side to approach
a summit, how best to pass a valley&mdash;whether
to go around or through it. With
knowledge of these matters, his occupation is a
most interesting one. Irresponsible and unauthorized
trail making should be discouraged.</p>

<p>A word of caution is, “Do, but don’t overdo.”
Particularly is this word of caution to be carried
in mind in the matter of blazing trails. Let the
marks be sufficient, and no more; let them be as
inconspicuous as is consistent with their purpose.
In marking trails, don’t blaze trees, nor deface
objects of interest and beauty. The best trail
mark is a colored arrow, affixed to tree trunk or
fence post, or painted on a rock face. Such an
arrow may, by color, position, and legends displayed
upon it, afford as much information as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
may be desired, about route, distance, elevation,
detours, springs, and other matters.</p>

<p>Resting places may be built; pavilions, perhaps,
in the woods, where walkers may have
lunch under protection from rain. Or, when
conditions justify, houses may be built and
equipped, to afford food and lodging. In this connection,
the <i lang="de">alpenhütten</i> elsewhere mentioned
(<a href="#Page_106">page 106</a>) will come to mind. In other places,
tents may be erected for the summer, and caretakers
employed.</p>

<p>In case a club has under its care a wide extent
of wilderness&mdash;as has the New York Section of
the Green Mountain Club, for example&mdash;a ranger
will be employed, and his duties will include the
care of trails, prevention of fires, and protection
of property. He may, if expedient, be constituted
game warden also.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Some of us have been blessed of the Gods,
permitted to make trail in the timberline country
of the Mt. Washington range. Everyone who
has tried it is unhappy till he is doing it again.
That is why there are so many trails there. I
came rather late; my experience in that fascinating
country has been little more than that of
the common or idiotic tramper, scuttling from
hut to hut on schedule. Always, summer or winter,
I am glad to be starting for timberline, and
content when there. When, after the long climb,
I suddenly realize that the trees are lowering
fast, that underbrush has vanished, that a sensation
of altitude and space is pressing for conscious
recognition, I feel a lift and urge&mdash;timberline
again!</p>

<p>“And what is timberline? It is the level at
which the mean annual temperature&mdash;yes, but it
is the sweep of vast spaces, the drift of cloud-shadows,
the infinite gradations of distant color.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
It is the hiss of wind in the firs, the strain
against bitter gusts, the keen concentration to
hold the trail through dense and drifting fog. It
is the plod and lift under the pack, the crunch of
creepers, the slow struggle through tangled
scrubs.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

</div>

<h5><i>Map Making</i></h5>

<p>Maps of unmapped regions should be prepared.</p>

<p>Study a good map&mdash;a quadrangle of the U. S.
Geological Survey, for instance. Note what
things are represented, and how representation
is made: study the map, until it is thoroughly
understood.</p>

<p>There are three factors with which the map-maker
deals: direction, distance, and elevation.
With the first, he must always reckon, and usually
with the second and the third as well.</p>

<p>Direction is fundamental. Suppose there are
three dominant points in the area to be mapped,
relatively situated as here indicated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/diagram3.jpg" width="700" height="320" alt="Points A, B and C in relation to each other. Roughly a triangle." />
</div>

<p>The first problem is, to get those points set
down on paper accurately, in proper relative positions.</p>

<p>The map-maker begins, say, at <i>B</i>. He has provided
himself with a <em>sketching board</em>, having a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
sheet of paper tacked upon it, and with a ruler
and a <em>pencil</em>. He sets his board up and carefully
levels it. He then marks upon the paper a point
<i>b</i> which in the completed map is to indicate this
station <i>B</i> of first observation&mdash;the point where
he now stands. Knowing in a general way the
area which he wishes to map, and observing from
his station the directions in which the distant
objects <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> lie, he so places point <i>b</i> that his
paper will afford space for the intended map.</p>

<p>The map-maker then lays his ruler upon the
paper, brings its edge close to point <i>b</i>, and sighting
from point <i>b</i> on the paper to the distant object
<i>A</i>, turns the ruler until its edge coincides
with the line of sight. Then he draws upon the
paper a line or “ray” from point <i>b</i> toward object
<i>A</i>. In like manner he sets his ruler again and
draws a second ray, from <i>b</i> toward the distant
object <i>C</i>, thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/diagram4.jpg" width="700" height="340" alt="Points A, b and C. Ruled rays as described above." />
</div>

<p>Having fixed point <i>b</i> and drawn the two rays
<i>b-A</i> and <i>b-C</i>, the map-maker leaves station <i>B</i> and
goes to either of the other points: to point <i>C</i>, say.
He there sets his board up again, and levels it
carefully as before. He turns the board until,
sighting along the previously drawn ray <i>C-b</i>,
the now distant station <i>B</i> is exactly covered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Then he lays the ruler again upon the paper,
and turns it until, sighting along its edge, distant
object <i>A</i> is exactly covered. He then draws a
ray along the edge of the ruler thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/diagram5.jpg" width="700" height="340" alt="Points A, B, a, b, c. Ruled rays as described above." />
</div>

<p>The points <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>, where this ray intersects
the two previously drawn rays, are the presentment
of the points <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> in the area under
observation, and a map of the area is begun.</p>

<p>These three points may be mountain summits,
trees, telegraph poles, chimneys, or any other
conspicuous features of the landscape, and they
may be distant one from another 50 miles or 500
yards; they are set down on paper in their true
relative positions; they are <em>mapped</em>.</p>

<p>In the making of the map thus far, one and
only one of the three factors mentioned above
has been taken into the reckoning: the factor
of <em>direction</em>, namely; and the resulting map is
drawn to an unknown scale. It is drawn to <em>some</em>
scale, of course; there is <em>some</em> ratio between its
distances and the distances at which the objects
stand apart, but the ratio is unknown. It may
be determined: the distance from <i>B</i> to <i>C</i> may be
measured, and the distance <i>b-c</i> on the map may
be measured, and the ratio of the two distances
ascertained. That ratio is the scale to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the map is drawn. Thus the second factor, that
of <em>distance</em>, enters in. It may be reckoned with
from the beginning.</p>

<p>Suppose the two points <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, above mentioned,
to be signal towers on a straight stretch
of railway, and the point <i>A</i> to be the chimney
of a house standing by the side of a wagon road
which crosses the railroad at <i>C</i>. The map-maker,
having at <i>B</i> set down the data described above, in
proceeding to <i>C</i>, paces the distance from <i>B</i> to <i>C</i>,
and finds it to be, <i>e.g.</i>, 3,500 feet. He has previously
determined what the scale of his map is to
be: say, 1 inch to 1000 feet. He then carefully lays
off on ray <i>b-C</i> 3½ inches from the point <i>b</i>, and
thus he fixes point <i>c</i>. He then sets up his drawing-board
at <i>C</i>; but, instead of shifting the ruler
freely upon the paper, he sights from point <i>c</i> to
distant object <i>A</i> and brings the edge of the ruler
into coincidence with the line of sight. He draws
along the edge of the ruler the ray <i>c-A</i>, which,
intersecting the previously drawn ray <i>b-A</i>, gives
him the point <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>The railroad from <i>b</i> to <i>c</i> may be indicated thus,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/diagram6.jpg" width="300" height="50" alt="Sketch of railroad tracks." />
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the highroad from <i>c</i> to <i>a</i> represented by two
closely spaced parallel lines. (The conventional
signs for various features of topography may be
found on the back of a U. S. Geological Survey
quadrangle.) On the way from <i>B</i> to <i>C</i> there may
be a bridge, crossing a stream. The map-maker,
pacing the distance, will, without stopping or interrupting
the swing of his stride, note the number
of paces from <i>B</i> to the bridge, as well as from
<i>B</i> to <i>C</i>. He will then have the figures, and can
accurately place the bridge upon his map.</p>

<p>He now has a map of a length of railroad and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of a length of intersecting highway, drawn to
the known scale of 1″ = 1000′.</p>

<p>And, be it noted, this has been accomplished
without visiting the point <i>A</i> at all.</p>

<p>Suppose now there be a haystack <i>D</i>, and a tree
on a hilltop <i>E</i>, situated with respect to the points
already considered thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/diagram7.jpg" width="700" height="260" alt="Points A, B, C, D, E in relation to each other." />
</div>

<p>They may be mapped in like manner. The
map-maker goes successively to any two of the
three points <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i> from which the object
to be plotted (<i>D</i> or <i>E</i>) is visible; he sets his
board at each place, levels it, and turns it until
the ray on the map from the point where he
stands to another point lies directly in the line of
sight to that other point in the landscape. Having
so oriented his board, he draws at his successive
stations rays in the direction of the object to be
mapped (<i>D</i> or <i>E</i>.) The point <i>d</i> or <i>e</i> where those
rays intersect will be the mapped location of the
object.</p>

<p>Proceeding thus, the outstanding features of
the area may be mapped, one after another. The
intervening details may be filled in, freehand.</p>

<p>It will have been remarked that only very
simple apparatus is required for map making:
the <em>sketching board</em> may conveniently be mounted
on a tripod, with provision for turning it evenly
and surely. Boards so mounted and intended for
the very purpose may be had of dealers in draftsmen’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and surveyors’ supplies. A <em>level</em> should be
provided, for use in setting the board up. The
<em>ruler</em> will be graduated to inches and fractions
of inches, if the map is to be drawn to predetermined
scale. In pacing, one must carefully
count his strides. A <em>pedometer</em> may be used,
but a pedometer is a sort of toy; it requires to
be carefully adjusted to the stride of the user,
and is hardly worth while for any purpose. It
may be convenient in pacing to use a <em>tally
register</em>, and so relieve one’s self of the necessity
of keeping count.</p>

<p>The value of a map is vitally dependent on the
accuracy with which it is made. Measurement
and observation should be repeated, and errors
eliminated by averaging variant readings.</p>

<p>Nothing has yet been said about a <em>compass</em>,
and a compass, though not necessary, is so serviceable
as to be almost indispensable. With a
compass one can not only do, and do more expeditiously,
what has thus far been described;
he can do some things which could not otherwise
be done.</p>

<p>A sketching board is ordinarily provided with a
compass, set near its upper margin, and bears also
an orientation line passing through the compass.
The board is set up and leveled and then turned
until the orientation line coincides with the line
on which the needle points. At each station the
board is oriented, not by sighting along penciled
rays, but always in the manner described, by
bringing it to a truly north and south position.
In other respects, the plotting is performed in
the manner already described.</p>

<p>Orientation by compass is advantageous in this
respect: given two points, as <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, on the map,
the map-maker may plot a third point, as <i>D</i> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
example, while standing at <i>D</i>, and without being
obliged to go either to <i>A</i> or to <i>B</i>. He sets up his
board at <i>D</i>, levels it, and orients it; he sights
and draws rays through points <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in line
with the objects <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> as they appear from
his point of observation, <i>D</i>. The point <i>d</i> of intersection
of the rays will be the station <i>D</i>
plotted.</p>

<p>A north and south line may be drawn upon
the map, and then the user, wherever he may be
in the area, if only he has in view two known
points and can identify them on the map, can
“find” himself. He orients the map by compass,
fixes upon the map and in the manner indicated
his point of observation, and may then observe
the distance and direction of any other point in
the area, whether visible or not.</p>

<p>The measurement of distance by <em>pacing</em> has
been noted. Practice is requisite, before one can
so measure distance accurately. When the greatest
precision is desired, a bicycle wheel equipped
with a cyclometer may be rolled over the course,
or a surveyor’s chain may be used, or even a
tape line.</p>

<p>The measured line <i>B-C</i> of the map begun as
above described is the base line of the map. It
should be carefully chosen, carefully measured,
and carefully plotted; for all the rest of the map
will, in accuracy, be conditioned on the accuracy
with which this base line is drawn. In location
it is preferably (though not necessarily) situated
near the center of the area to be mapped;
in length, it is best that it be about one third
of the distance across the area. Its terminal
points should be conspicuously marked, and
widely visible throughout the area; and, for ease
and accuracy of measurement, it should lie across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
level ground. A reach of railroad is an ideal
base.</p>

<p>It will often be the case&mdash;generally in mountainous
regions&mdash;that an adequate level base cannot
be found; the terminals <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> may be
eminences unequal in height, and between may
lie mountain slope or valley. Now the third of
the factors mentioned at the outset, <em>elevation</em>,
has to be taken into account. It is not the surface
distance between the two points <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>
which is to be ascertained, nor even the distance
from one point to the other on an air line, but
the distance projected upon a horizontal plane&mdash;for
that is what the map is intended to afford,
the <em>horizontal</em> distance from point to point. In
order to determine this distance, if the ground
between be other than substantially level, the
distance along the surface must be measured
(keeping a straight course by compass if necessary)
and the <em>slope</em> from point to point must be
measured. To determine the angle of slope one
may either use a <em>slope board</em> or a <em>clinometer</em> (an
instrument built on the principle of the sextant).
Having measured distance and angle of slope, one
may betake himself to schoolboy trigonometry
and a table of logarithms, to determine the corresponding
distance in horizontal plane.</p>

<p><em>Contour lines</em> (see <a href="#Page_119">page 119</a>) pass through
points of equal elevation, and are spaced apart
according to a predetermined plan, to indicate
intervals in elevation of five, ten, or twenty feet,
as may be desired. This predetermined contour
interval has no necessary relation to the scale to
which the map is drawn. Two otherwise identical
maps of the same area may be provided with
contour lines, one at the interval of five feet, the
other at the interval of twenty-five.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>A skilled map-maker, observing a slope, is able
to sketch contour lines, freehand, with an accuracy
sufficient for most purposes. But such
skill is the result of much careful measured
work.</p>

<p>In plotting contour lines it is best to work, not
from line to line&mdash;errors of observation then accumulate&mdash;but
to measure the altitude and the
mean inclination of the whole mountain side, and
go from the over-all measurements to the
minutiae.</p>

<p>In drawing the contour of a mountain, rays
may be laid by compass from the summit along
ridges and through valleys, and then minute observations
may be made along those several lines.
The sweep of the contour lines between the points
plotted along the rays may be filled in freehand,
with the mountain side spread in view.</p>

<p>The data necessary for contour lines may be
got by the use of the slope board alone; for, manifestly,
at any certain angle, a contour interval
of ten feet means a certain distance between
successive contour lines. But in plotting contour
lines, an <em>aneroid</em> is invaluable; with it one
measures directly differences in elevation, and
measuring thus the altitude of a slope, from bottom
to top, the <em>number</em> of contour lines requisite
may immediately be known; it remains to determine
their <em>distribution</em>. Here observation, calculation,
and experience combine to afford the
result.</p>

<p>An aneroid should be used only under settled
conditions of weather; and, even so, correction
should be made, when possible, by taking the
average of many readings of the same range.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to go afield with sketching
board and its accessories. A map-maker who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
taught himself a well-regulated stride may, when
equipped with compass and notebook (and, if
conditions require it, with an aneroid), collect all
the necessary data; and then, subsequently, at
home he may draw his map. It should here be
said that, if one is going to gather data for map
making after the manner just suggested, his
compass should be one having a delicately
mounted needle. It may advantageously be
equipped with sights, and the scale should be
reasonably large and the graduation minute. It
should, in short, be a surveyor’s compass.</p>

<p>For more explicit instruction, the reader is
referred to the manuals on Military Map Making.
One by Major C. O. Sherrill, published by
George Banta Publishing Company of Menasha,
Wisconsin, is excellent. It should, however, be
remembered that the ideal military map is one
for particular needs, of maximum accuracy,
based on a minimum amount of observation;
timesaving is an important factor. Making
proper allowance, the military manual affords all
needed instruction and advice.</p>

<h5><i>Publishing of data</i></h5>

<p>Descriptions of routes should be prepared, illustrated
with maps, if necessary, and should be
made available to those who wish to use them,
whether members of the club, visitors from a
distance, or the general public. For a club,
rightly conceived, is, within its sphere, a public
benefactor, and its policy should be always to
enlarge its usefulness.</p>

<p>A proper description of a route should give,
(1) distances from start to finish, as well as
from point to point along the way; (2) approximate
time requisite to walk each stage. (Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
it may be noted that Baedeker’s famous guidebooks
err on the safe side, and give very liberal
time allowance in describing walking tours.)
The description should further give (3) elevations,
where range in elevation is appreciable,
with note of steep ascents and descents; (4) the
nature of the surface; (5) stopping places for
rest and refreshment and springs; (6) such matters
of caution as the particular route may require,
in regard to dangerous places, heavy roads,
obstructions, and the like; (7) objectives and
points of particular interest. Recommendations
should be made on such matters as preferred
season, special equipment, need for guides, and
incidental expenses. Descriptions should be concise,
easily intelligible, and should be at once
accurate and inviting.</p>

<p>A handbook of routes of the region may well
be prepared, and in such a handbook descriptions
of particular walks may be prefaced by
such general statements regarding topography,
science, history, and sport, as are applicable to
the whole region. Such general matters may,
however, be published in leaflet form, and separate
leaflets be prepared and published for the
several pedestrian routes in the region.</p>

<p>An excellent specimen handbook is “Excursions
Around Aix-les-Bains,” mentioned in the Bibliography
(<a href="#Page_148">page 148</a>).</p>

<p>It has just been said that the descriptions of
routes should be published and distributed. They
may be printed under the imprint of the club, or,
more economically, they may be published in the
local newspaper, and extra copies, separately
printed for distribution by the club, may be procured
by arrangement with the printing office.
If the club be a small one and young, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
cost of printing too great, at least typewritten
copies of descriptive matter and blue prints of
maps should be available.</p>

<p>In addition to such descriptions of its own
region, a club should similarly prepare and make
available other routes traversed by its members
in other and undeveloped regions.</p>

<h5><i>Maintaining a bureau</i></h5>

<p>A club should have a place where its data are
filed, available to those who wish to consult them.
This place should be a distributing point for the
club’s publications. If the region has already
been mapped by the Geological Survey, the club
should lay in a supply of the quadrangles covering
the region, sufficient to meet the needs of
applicants.</p>

<p>A <em>library</em> should be maintained, or a <em>bibliography</em>
at least, to which the members of the
club may have access, to acquaint themselves with
all that concerns the art of walking, the choice
of route, and the sources of enjoyment along the
route chosen. Cooperation in this regard will
readily be accorded by any local public library or
museum of natural history.</p>

<p>In such manner a walking club becomes a
source of information for visiting pedestrians.
Out of the wider relationships so established will
come increased membership and livelier interest.
Incidentally, it will have become apparent to one
who reads these pages that the organization&mdash;though,
by recommendation, kept as simple as
possible&mdash;will, in an early stage of development,
include an office with a secretary in charge. The
library may be conducted, perhaps in the secretary’s
office, perhaps in the rooms of a general
public library. Club rooms or a club house will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
be maintained only under exceptional circumstances.</p>

<h5><i>Conducting hikes.</i></h5>

<p>Hikes will be of two or three sorts: first, afternoon
hikes, on Saturdays or Sundays, perhaps
weekly throughout the greater part of the year,
perhaps at less frequent intervals, or during
spring and fall only&mdash;such matters depend on
locality and circumstances. Second, there will be
less frequent overnight hikes&mdash;perhaps two or
three in the spring and as many more in the
autumn. And, third, there will be the annual
tour of two or three weeks’ duration, in a chosen
region. Some observations applicable to all these
are the following:</p>

<h5><i>Rules for hiking</i></h5>

<p>Hikes should be carefully prepared and adequately
carried out.</p>

<p>Don’t walk in a herd; to do so is tiresome;
and, when the novelty is gone, failure is sure to
follow. Divide larger companies into groups,
each group numbering preferably not more than
six.</p>

<p>See that strong and feeble walkers are not
grouped together.</p>

<p>Bring together, so far as may be, people
of common interests&mdash;bird-lovers in one group,
geologists in another, historians or antiquarians
in another.</p>

<p>Let there be a leader for each group.</p>

<p>The general outline of the trip, in case the
party numbers more than two, should be determined
in advance and adhered to. Otherwise,
contradictory suggestions regarding the route to
be followed are likely to arise, and argument to
follow. This is to be avoided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The leader should have always in mind the
physical endurance of the weakest member of his
party and govern accordingly. One tired and
querulous person may be a kill-joy for all. It is
not necessary that every group traverse the same
route, nor that all should walk at equal speed.</p>

<p>Don’t allow racing, nor loitering, nor too much
picnicking.</p>

<p>In traversing highways pedestrians will walk
two or three abreast; but when walking single
file, as on woodland trails, companions will walk
most comfortably at intervals of two paces.</p>

<p>Walkers should travel quietly, especially when
passing through villages.</p>

<p>See that property rights are respected; there
should be no trespassing on forbidden land.</p>

<p>Guard most carefully against fire. Mr. Enos
A. Mills says:<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>“Since the day of Tike’s Peak or bust,’ fires
have swept over more than half of the primeval
forest area of Colorado. Some years ago, while
making special efforts to prevent forest fires from
starting, I endeavored to find out the cause of
these fires. I regretfully found that most of
them were the result of carelessness, and I also
made a note to the effect that there are few worse
things to be guilty of than carelessly setting fire
to a forest. Most of these forest fires had their
origin from camp-fires which the departing
campers had left unextinguished. There were
sixteen fires in one summer, which I attributed
to the following causes: campers, nine; cigar,
one; lightning, one; locomotive, one; stockmen,
two; sheep-herders, one; and sawmill, one.”</p>

<p>See to it that proper regard is had for public
interest and welfare; lunch boxes, paper, and
refuse should be collected and destroyed; springs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
should be kept scrupulously clean; the gathering
of wild flowers should be indulged in sparingly;
plants and trees should not be mutilated; nor
monuments defaced. The trail should be left unmarred,
for those who follow.</p>

<p>Do not permit irresponsible trail-blazing.</p>

<p>Discourage the carrying and use of firearms;
they should under no circumstances be permitted
on an organized hike.</p>

<p>Do not permit the rolling of stones down declivities.</p>

<p>On the conduct of mountaineering parties, Professor
William Morris Davis writes, in “Excursions
around Aix-les-Bains”:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Do not make high mountain ascents alone.…
Excursions are best made in small
parties of three or five. If a large party sets out,
it should be divided into squads of ten or fewer
members. Those who wish to make the excursion
without stopping should join a separate
squad from those who wish to stop frequently
for photographing or sketching.</p>

<p>“Each squad should, if possible, have an experienced
leader; he should make a list of the
members, head the line of march on narrow
paths, and set the proper pace, slow for ascents,
faster for descents; a shrill whistle will aid in
summoning his party together. A marshal
should follow in the rear to round up the stragglers.
Before setting out on a long mountain
walk, place the members of each squad in a circle
land let each member take note of his two neighbors,
one on his right, one on his left, for whose
presence he is to be responsible whenever the
march begins after a halt: each member will thus
be looked for by two others. Once on the road,
keep together; those who wander away from
their squad cause vexatious delays. The marshal’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
report, ‘All present and ready to start,’ is especially
important when a descent begins. If a
member wishes to leave his squad after low
ground is reached, he should so report to his
leader.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Albert Handy<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> notes another matter, in
the following pleasant and sagacious comment
upon walking parties:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A writer on walking has suggested that
tramping parties should usually consist of but
two or three persons. Having in mind a much
hackneyed quotation concerning the trend of a
young man’s fancy in the spring, and the fact that
it seems to have the same trend in the summer,
autumn, and winter, I can conceive circumstances
in which two would be an ideal number&mdash;out of
consideration, primarily, not for the two, but for
the remainder of the party. But I set down here
another precept worthy of commendation: ‘twosing’
should be sternly frowned upon. In the first
place, two ‘twosers’ are apt to get ‘lost’&mdash;this in
direct proportion to their interest in each other&mdash;that
is, separated from the rest of the party; and
time and tempers are likewise lost, permanently,
very likely, in the effort to retrieve the wanderers;
while if they happen to be carrying all the
lunch, tragic possibilities present themselves.”</p>

</div>

<p><em>Instruction</em> about walking&mdash;about posture, gait,
clothing, and the like&mdash;may be afforded in talks
before groups of pedestrians, or (often with better
effect) individually, by the group leader.
Needless criticism and officiousness will, of
course, be avoided; it will suffice to provoke and
then to answer questions.</p>

<p><em>Contributions to the literature of pedestrianism</em>
will take the form of description of particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
regions in those respects of interest to pedestrians;
it will include descriptions of particular
walks, and maps.</p>

<p>Clubs are invited to relate themselves to the
League of Walkers (<a href="#Page_137">page 137</a>), which in publishing
such material will of necessity give preference
to what is to be commended to widest
interest.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Club Policy</span></h4>

<p>With such activities in mind as normal to a
pedestrian club, certain matters of policy may be
presented for consideration.</p>

<p>Two tendencies are sure to manifest themselves
in any flourishing club: the one toward a
limited membership of those who qualify by accomplishing
difficult feats; the other toward an
indiscriminate membership, including those who
are ready to join anything&mdash;providing the rest
do. Both tendencies are bad. The club should
on the one hand require of its members an especial
interest in the object of its being, but it
should on the other hand avoid exclusiveness.
Emulation may be stimulated in other and better
ways.</p>

<p>The aim of a club should be to bring home and
make available to as many persons as possible the
advantages in health and happiness to be derived
from the pursuit of this recreation. This is a
higher and better aim than to produce phenomenal
walkers and mountain climbers&mdash;though
such may incidentally be produced. It is a higher
and better aim than a self-adulating company of
those who have perched themselves on alps.
Alpine climbing is splendid sport, but the aim
mentioned is an ignoble one. Says one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
mountaineer,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who is incidentally a delightful writer,
with humility:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I utterly repudiate the doctrine that Alpine
travellers are or ought to be the heroes of Alpine
adventures. The true way at least to describe
all my Alpine ascents is that Michel or Anderegg
or Lauener succeeded in performing a feat requiring
skill, strength, and courage, the difficulty
of which was much increased by the difficulty of
taking with him his knapsack and his employer.
If any passages in the succeeding pages convey
the impression that I claim any credit except that
of following better men than myself with decent
ability, I disavow them in advance and do penance
for them in my heart.”</p>

</div>

<p>Avoid membership campaigns and such like advertising;
a club to be enduring must rest on
interest in the intrinsic thing for which the club
stands. An artificially created interest must be
artificially maintained; genuine natural interest
is harmed by artificial interference.</p>

<p>Dues should not be burdensome, discouraging
membership, but should be adequate to accomplish
reasonable ends, and so tend to enlist and
to widen interest.</p>

<p>Attention should center on the primary activities
and upon them chiefly money should be
spent.</p>

<p>Publications should be sold at cost.</p>

<p>Adequate charge should be made for the use
of property. The Alpine clubs of Europe fix
small membership fees, and give members preference
over non-members in their lodging places.
Members enjoy more favorable rates also for
meals and lodging. The ideal of the club here
should be a nice balance of simplicity, comfort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and adequacy; no waste, no extravagance, no surplus
funds.</p>

<p>Club <em>emblems</em> are often adopted and worn. As
in other sports, emulation may be awakened by
the offer of <em>trophies</em>. These may be won in competition,
or, as is usually preferred, by walking
a certain number of miles in a day, or by covering
a certain distance in a two-weeks’ hike, or
the like.</p>

<p>In any case, organization should be simple and
inconspicuous: the wheels should turn automatically.</p>

<p>If acquisition of property is contemplated, incorporation
will ordinarily be desired, and
trustees will be chosen.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Club Constitution</span></h4>

<p>For the benefit of those who may consider organization,
a copy of the by-laws of the Appalachian
Mountain Club is, by permission, here inserted.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h5>BY-LAWS</h5>

<h6><span class="smcap">Article I</span></h6>

<p>The Corporation shall be called the <span class="smcap">Appalachian
Mountain Club</span>.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Article II</span></h6>

<p>The objects of the Club are to explore the mountains
of New England and the adjacent regions,
both for scientific and artistic purposes; and, in
general, to cultivate an interest in geographical
studies.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Article III</span><br />
MEMBERSHIP</h6>

<p>1. There shall be three classes of membership,
to be known as active, corresponding, and honorary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Active members only, except as hereinafter
provided, shall be members of the Corporation.</p>

<p>3. Elections to active membership shall be made
by the Council, and the affirmative votes of at least
four-fifths of the members present and voting shall
be necessary to election.&mdash;Nominations, in the form
of a recommendation, shall be made in writing by
at least two members of the Club and forwarded
to the Recording Secretary. Notice of such nominations
shall be sent to all active members, who shall
have two weeks from the date of mailing in which
to express to the Council their objections, and no
person shall be admitted to membership against
the written protest of ten members of the Club.</p>

<p>4. Corresponding members may be elected from
among persons distinguished in the fields of mountaineering,
exploration, and geographical science, or
for public spirit in the conservation of natural resources
or in other interests of which the Club is
an exponent. Their election shall be in the manner
prescribed for that of active members, except that
the names of candidates shall first be submitted to
a special committee.&mdash;Honorary members, not to exceed
twenty-five in number, may be elected in the
same manner from among the Corresponding members.&mdash;Corresponding
and Honorary members shall
not be members of the Corporation, unless they were
such at the time of their election, and shall not be
subject to any fees or liabilities whatever.</p>

<p>5. The annual dues shall be four dollars, payable
January first. Each candidate elected to active
membership shall pay an admission fee of eight
dollars, and on such payment shall be exempt from
the annual dues of the current year.&mdash;The admission
fee and annual dues of members under twenty-one
years of age shall be half the above rates.&mdash;Members
elected later than September of any year shall
be exempt from annual dues of the year following.&mdash;Persons
elected to active membership shall pay the
admission fee within two months of their election<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
(which payment shall be considered to be an assent
to these By-laws), otherwise the election shall be
void.</p>

<p>6. Any person elected to active membership may
become a life member at any time upon payment
of fifty dollars, and shall thereafter be subject to
no fees or assessments. Such sum shall include payment
of the admission fee or dues for the current
year. Active members who have completed thirty
years of membership, or who have completed twenty
years of membership and have reached seventy years
of age, shall become life members upon giving written
notice to the Recording Secretary, or by vote
of the Council.</p>

<p>7. Bills for annual dues shall be sent to all members
on or near January first, and those whose dues
are unpaid on April first shall have notice of the
fact sent them by the Treasurer. He shall send, on
May first, to members whose dues are still unpaid,
notice referring to this article, and those in arrears
on June first shall thereupon cease to be members,
which fact, in each case, shall be certified in writing
by the Treasurer to the Recording Secretary, who
shall enter it of record; but such membership may
be revived by the Council in its discretion upon
payment of past dues. The President and Treasurer
are authorized to remit any fee <i lang="la">sub silentio</i>,
when they deem it advisable.</p>

<p>8. If the Council by four-fifths vote shall decide
that the name of any member should be dropped
from the roll, due notice shall be sent to such member,
who shall within two weeks have the right to
demand that the matter be referred to an investigating
committee of five active members of the Club,
two to be appointed by the Council&mdash;but not from
its own number&mdash;two to be selected by the member,
and the fifth to be chosen by these four. In the
absence of such a demand, or if a majority of this
committee shall approve the decision of the Council,
the name of the member shall be dropped, and thereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the interest of such person in the Corporation
and its property shall cease.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Article IV</span><br />
ADMINISTRATION</h6>

<p>1. The officers of the Club shall be a President,
two Vice-Presidents, Recording Secretary, Corresponding
Secretary, Treasurer, four Departmental

as chairmen, and to appoint departmental committees,
subject to the control of the Council. They
shall present at the annual meeting reports of their
respective departments for the year.</p>

<p>7. There shall be a Board of Trustees of Real
Estate, consisting of a member of the Council, to

Club, one being elected annually by ballot to serve
four years and until his successor is chosen.&mdash;These
Trustees shall elect annually from their own number
a chairman and such other officers as may
be required, and may employ such assistance
as they shall find necessary. They shall administer
and manage any real estate which may be held by
the Club as a public trust; subject, however, to the
general supervision of the Council.&mdash;Any real estate
other than public trust reservations to which the
Club holds title shall be managed under the direction
of the Council, but nothing herein shall be construed
to mean that the management of such property
may not be delegated to the said Board of
Trustees or to a standing committee created for the
purpose.&mdash;No real estate shall be acquired or title
to the same accepted except by vote of the Council
upon the recommendation of this Board.&mdash;The
Trustees of Real Estate shall make to the Club at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the annual meeting a report in writing relative to
the property committed to their care, together with
a statement of the finances connected with their
trust.</p>

<p>8. There shall also be a Board of Trustees of
Special Funds, consisting of three members of the
Club, one being chosen by ballot annually to serve
for three years and until his successor is elected.
They shall choose their own chairman. The Treasurer
of the Club shall not be eligible to election upon
this Board.&mdash;All permanent endowments and funds
of a permanent or special nature (unless otherwise
legally restricted), as well as the Reserve Fund
hereinafter provided, shall be entrusted to these
Trustees, and they shall have power to make, change,
and sell investments.&mdash;All moneys received for life
membership, and such other sums as may be received
or appropriated for this special purpose, shall
be known and invested separately as the Permanent
Fund, of which the income only shall be expended.&mdash;There
shall also be a Reserve Fund to and from
which appropriations may be made by not less than
five affirmative votes at each of two meetings of the
Council, notice of the proposed action having been
given on the call for the second meeting.&mdash;At each
annual meeting, and at such other times as the Club
or Council may request, the Trustees of Special
Funds shall make a written statement of the condition
of each of the funds in their hands.</p>

<p>9. The fiscal year of the Club shall end on December
31. The Council shall at the close of each
year employ an expert accountant to audit the books
and accounts of the Treasurer and of the Boards

the written report of his findings; it may also
cause to be audited in the same manner the accounts
of other agents and committees of the Club.</p>

<p>10. The following Standing Committees shall be
appointed: on Publications; on Field Meetings and
Excursions; on Legislation; on Active Membership;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and on Honorary and Corresponding Membership.
These Committees shall consist of not less than five
members each, and members of the Council shall be
eligible to appointment thereon. They shall be
vested with such powers as the Council sees fit to
delegate to them, and nothing herein shall be construed
as prohibiting that body from appointing
such other committees as may be required.</p>

by them, to the Recording Secretary, and the names
of such candidates, in addition to those presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
by the Nominating Committee, shall be printed on
the call for the annual meeting and upon the ballots.
No person shall be eligible to office unless nominated
in accordance with the foregoing provisions.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Article VI</span><br />
MEETINGS</h6>

<p>The Council, or the officers to whom it may delegate
this power, shall call a regular meeting of the
Club in Boston in each month except between June

been sent to all active members.</p>

</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Juvenile Clubs</span></h4>

<p>What has been said of the conduct of clubs
generally will, so far as it is worth the saying,
afford sufficient suggestion to school teachers,
secretaries of young men’s and young women’s
Christian associations, and other welfare workers.
Organization is not the important thing.
The important thing is to direct the minds and
activities of young people into wholesome and
educative channels.</p>

<p>In dealing with boys and girls the educational
factor in pedestrianism becomes more important.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Lessons in biology, geology, astronomy, and history
are more adequately taught and more thoroughly
learned, when teacher and pupil come face
to face with the actual physical objects to which
study is directed. And the way opens wide here,
not for natural and social science, merely, but for
seemingly more remote subjects: surveying, for
instance, and cartography; appreciation of architecture
and of other fine arts; sketching and
English composition. Incidentally, powers of
observation, memory, thought are quickened, and
physical well-being promoted.</p>

<p>Even in such minor matters as clothing and
shoes, a good deal of folly among boys and girls
may be dissipated, to the substantial benefit of
these same girls and boys when older grown.</p>

<p>The handbook of the Boy Scouts will be found
particularly suggestive and helpful to those in
charge of walking for young people.</p>

<p>Much wider use is made in Europe than in this
country of excursions as a feature of school life;
here as well as over there, excursions afoot may
be encouraged. But teachers must themselves
become pedestrians, before such advantages and
enjoyment as walking affords will become available
to school children generally.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The League of Walkers</span></h4>

<p>The plans for the League, as thus far developed,
are:</p>

<p>To encourage the organization of walking
clubs, and to cooperate with such organizations,
aiding them in making their proposals inviting.</p>

<p>To maintain a Bureau of Information, where
specific advice about particular walks and particular
regions will be preserved and made available<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to all applicants. Particular attention will
be given to collecting data concerning scenery,
geology, history, and, generally, matters of interest
on particular walks.</p>

<p>To publish a “blue book” or guidebook for
pedestrians.</p>

<p>To give advice regarding clothing, equipment,
training, etc.</p>

<p>To promote inter-Association and other inter-club
walking tours.</p>

<p>Certificates will be given to walking clubs
which enroll in the League. The cost of enrolment
is $1.00, simply to pay for the cost of the
certificate.</p>

<p>Members of constituent walking clubs may
wear bronze buttons or pins bearing the emblem
of the League. These may be procured at a nominal
cost at 347 Madison Avenue, New York.</p>

<p>A bronze medallion, to be worn as a watch fob,
will be awarded to any one, a member of a constituent
walking club, who walks 30 miles in
twenty-four hours, or 150 miles in two weeks, or
who makes a mountain climb of 3,000 feet in a
day. An applicant for a medallion will furnish
with his application two letters, in addition to
his own, from those best advised, stating the
facts as they know them. The secretary of the
club of which the applicant is a member (it may
be of a Y. M. C. A.) should also write, and his
may be one of the two letters required, as just
said. If possible, the letters should be written
by persons present, one at the start and the other
at the finish of the feat. The applicants will pay
the cost of the medallion.</p>

<p>A silver medallion will be awarded, at the expense
of the League, one each year, (1) to the
person who sends to the Bureau the best original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
essay on walking, based upon actual experience;
(2) to the person who sends to the Bureau the
best epitome of a walking tour; and (3) to the
person who sends to the Bureau the best photograph
taken on a walk.</p>

<p>A silver medallion may be awarded to one who
performs some notable feat in walking, or who
renders some valuable service in the interest of
walking.</p>

<p>Special recognition will be given each year to
that walking organization which has rendered
the best service to the walking movement.</p>

<p>The emblem of the League is pictured in the
design appearing in the frontispiece. The design
was modeled by Mr. Royal B. Farnum, Specialist
in Industrial Arts in the New York Department
of Education, at the instance of Dr.
John H. Finley, President of the University of
the State of New York.</p>

<p>The desire of the League is to inspire and incite
people to get out of doors, to walk regularly
and systematically, to cultivate a love for the
open, and to develop health and vigor and the joy
of well-being.</p>

<p>All organizations interested are requested, for
the common good, to communicate with the New
York Bureau all data respecting regions under
cultivation, and respecting particular walks and
tours.</p>

<p>Communications should be addressed to the
League of Walkers, 347, Madison Avenue, New
York City.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
